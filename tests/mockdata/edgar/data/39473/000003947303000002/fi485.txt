Risk/Return Summary

The fund seeks to make your investment grow and provide you with income over
time by investing primarily in common stocks of large, established companies
that offer growth potential at reasonable prices. The fund may also invest
significantly in non-U.S. securities.

The fund is designed for investors seeking both capital appreciation and income.
 Your investment in the fund is subject to risks, including the possibility that
the fund's income and the value of its investments may fluctuate in response to
events specifically involving the companies in which the fund invests, as well
as economic, political or social events in the U.S. or abroad.

Although all securities in the fund's portfolio may be adversely affected by
currency fluctuations or global economic, political or social instability,
securities issued by entities based outside the U.S. may be affected to a
greater extent.

Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or
guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government
agency, entity or person.

YOU MAY LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN THE FUND. THE LIKELIHOOD OF LOSS IS GREATER
IF YOU INVEST FOR A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME.

HISTORICAL INVESTMENT RESULTS

The following information provides some indication of the risks of investing in
the fund by showing changes in the fund's investment results from year to year
and by showing how the fund's average annual total returns for various periods
compare with those of a broad measure of market performance. Past results are
not an indication of future results.

[begin bar chart]
Calendar Year Total Results for Class A Shares
(Results do not include a sales charge; if one were included, results would
 be lower)
1993    18.16
1994     1.33
1995    34.21
1996    19.99
1997    26.68
1998    16.72
1999    24.58
2000     4.27
2001    -9.55
2002   -17.34

Unlike the bar chart on the previous page, the Investment Results Table on the
following page reflects, as required by Securities and Exchange Commission
rules, the fund's investment results with the maximum initial or deferred sales
charge imposed. Class A share results reflect the maximum initial sales charge
of 5.75%. Class A sales charges are reduced for purchases of $25,000 or more.

Class B share results reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge.
These charges begin to decline after 12 months and are eliminated after six
years.

Results would be higher if calculated without a sales charge. All fund results
reflect the reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions.

The fund's results are shown on a pre-tax and after-tax basis, as required by
Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Total returns shown "after taxes on
distributions" reflect the effect of taxes on distributions (for example,
dividends or capital gain distributions) by the fund. Total returns shown "after
taxes on distributions and sale of fund shares" assume that you sold your fund
shares at the end of the particular time period, and as a result, reflect the
effect of both taxes on distributions by the fund and taxes on any gain or loss
realized upon the sale of the shares.

After-tax returns are calculated using the highest historical individual federal
income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes.
After-tax returns are shown only for Class A shares; after-tax returns for other
share classes will vary.

YOUR ACTUAL AFTER-TAX RETURNS DEPEND ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL TAX SITUATION AND LIKELY
WILL DIFFER FROM THE RESULTS SHOWN ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.  IN ADDITION,
AFTER-TAX RETURNS MAY NOT BE RELEVANT IF YOU HOLD YOUR FUND SHARES THROUGH
TAX-DEFERRED ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS A 401(K) PLAN, INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT
OR COLLEGEAMERICA ACCOUNT.

Because the fund's Class 529 shares were first available on February 15, 2002,
comparable results for these classes are not available for the 2002 calendar
year.

Unlike the Investment Results Table on the following page, the Investment
Results Table on page 8 reflects the fund's results calculated without a sales
charge.

1 Lifetime results are measured from August 1, 1978, when Capital Research and
 Management Company became investment adviser for the fund's Class A shares.
2 The Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index is a market capitalization-weighted
 index based on the average weighted performance of 500 widely held common
 stocks. This index is unmanaged.
3 The Lipper Large-Cap Core Index consists of funds that invest at least 75% of
 their equity assets in companies having relatively large market
 capitalizations. These funds typically have an average price-to-earnings ratio,
 price-to-book ratio, and three-year sales-per-share growth value, compared to
 the S&P 500 Index. This index is unmanaged and includes reinvested dividends,
 capital gain distributions, and brokerage commissions paid by the funds for
 portfolio transactions, but does not reflect sales charges, expenses or taxes.
 This index was not in existence as of the date Capital Research and Management
 Company became the fund's investment adviser; therefore, lifetime results are
 not available.

EXAMPLES

The examples below are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the
fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The examples assume that
you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated, that your
investment has a 5% return each year, that all dividends and capital gain
distributions are reinvested, and that the fund's operating expenses remain the
same as shown on the previous page. The examples assuming redemption do not
reflect the effect of any taxable gain or loss at the time of the redemption.


Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions,
your cumulative estimated expenses would be:

Investment Objective, Strategies and Risks

The fund's investment objective is to achieve long-term growth of capital and
income. The fund invests primarily in common stocks or securities convertible
into common stocks and may invest significantly in securities of issuers
domiciled outside the U.S. and not included in the Standard & Poor's 500
Composite Index.

The prices of and the income generated by securities held by the fund may
decline in response to certain events, including: those directly involving the
companies whose securities are owned in the fund; conditions affecting the
general economy; overall market changes; local, regional or global political,
social or economic instability; and currency and interest rate fluctuations.

Investments in securities issued by entities based outside the U.S. may be
subject to the risks described above to a greater extent and may also be
affected by differing securities regulations, higher transaction costs, and
administrative difficulties such as delays in clearing and settling portfolio
transactions.

The fund may also hold cash or money market instruments. The size of the fund's
cash position will vary and will depend on various factors, including market
conditions and purchases and redemptions of fund shares. A larger cash position
could detract from the achievement of the fund's objective in a period of rising
market prices; conversely, it would reduce the fund's magnitude of loss in the
event of a general market downturn and provide liquidity to make additional
investments or to meet redemptions.

The fund relies on the professional judgment of its investment adviser, Capital
Research and Management Company, to make decisions about the fund's portfolio
investments. The basic investment philosophy of the investment adviser is to
seek attractively priced securities that represent above average long-term
investment opportunities. The investment adviser believes that the best way to
accomplish this is through fundamental analysis, including meeting with company
executives and employees, suppliers, customers and competitors. Securities may
be sold when the investment adviser believes they no longer represent good
long-term value.

OTHER IMPORTANT INVESTMENT PRACTICES

In addition to the principal investment strategies described above, the fund has
other investment practices that are described in this prospectus and in the
statement of additional information.

The fund may invest to a limited extent in lower quality debt securities rated
Ba and BB or below or unrated but determined to be of equivalent quality. The
prices of debt securities fluctuate depending on such factors as changing
interest rates, effective maturities and credit ratings. For example, their
prices generally decline when interest rates rise and vice versa. Lower quality
or longer maturity debt securities generally have higher rates of


                                    7

interest and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality or
shorter maturity debt securities.

1 Lifetime results are measured from August 1, 1978, when Capital Research and
 Management Company became investment adviser for the fund's Class A shares.
2 The Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index is a market capitalization-weighted
 index based on the average weighted performance of 500 widely held common
 stocks. This index is unmanaged.
3 The Lipper Large-Cap Core Index consists of funds that invest at least 75% of
 their equity assets in companies having relatively large market
 capitalizations. These funds typically have an average price-to-earnings ratio,
 price-to-book ratio, and three-year sales-per-share growth value, compared to
 the S&P 500 Index. This index is unmanaged and includes reinvested dividends,
 capital gain distributions, and brokerage commissions paid by the funds for
 portfolio transactions, but does not reflect sales charges, expenses or taxes.
 This index was not in existence as of the date Capital Research and Management
 Company became the fund's investment adviser; therefore, lifetime results are
 not available.
4 The distribution rate is based on actual distributions paid to shareholders
 over a 12-month period. Capital gain distributions are added back to the net
 asset value to determine the rate.

Choosing a Share Class

The fund offers different classes of shares through this prospectus. Class A, B,
C and F shares may be purchased through various investment programs or accounts,
including many types of retirement plans. The services or share classes
available to you may vary depending upon how you wish to purchase shares of the
fund.

Investors residing in any state may purchase Class 529-A, 529-B, 529-C, 529-E
and 529-F shares through an account established with CollegeAmerica. Class
529-A, 529-B, 529-C and 529-F shares are structured similarly to the
corresponding Class A, B, C and F shares. For example, the same initial sales
charges apply to Class 529-A shares as they do to Class A shares. Class 529-E
shares are only available to investors participating in CollegeAmerica through
an eligible employer plan.

Each share class represents investments in the same portfolio of securities, but
each class has its own sales charge and expense structure, allowing you to
choose the class that best meets your situation. WHEN YOU PURCHASE SHARES OF THE
FUND, YOU MUST CHOOSE A SHARE CLASS. IF NONE IS CHOSEN, YOUR INVESTMENT WILL BE
MADE IN CLASS A SHARES OR, IN THE CASE OF A COLLEGEAMERICA INVESTMENT, CLASS
529-A SHARES.

Factors you should consider in choosing a class of shares include:

. how long you expect to own the shares;

. how much you intend to invest;

. total expenses associated with owning shares of each class;

. whether you qualify for any reduction or waiver of sales charges (for
  example, Class A or 529-A shares may be a less expensive option over time if
  you qualify for a sales charge reduction or waiver);

. whether you plan to take any distributions in the near future (for example,
  the contingent deferred sales charge will not be waived if you sell your Class
  529-B or 529-C shares to cover higher education expenses);

. Class B and C shares are generally not available to certain retirement plans,
  including employer-sponsored retirement plans such as 401(k) plans, 457 plans,
  employer-sponsored 403(b) plans, and money purchase pension and profit sharing
  plans;

. Class F and 529-F shares are generally only available to fee-based programs
  of investment firms that have special agreements with the fund's distributor
  and certain registered investment advisers.

EACH INVESTOR'S FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS ARE DIFFERENT. YOU SHOULD SPEAK WITH
YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISER TO HELP YOU DECIDE WHICH SHARE CLASS IS BEST FOR YOU.

UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, REFERENCES IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES TO CLASS A, B, C OR F
SHARES ALSO REFER TO THE CORRESPONDING CLASS 529-A, 529-B, 529-C OR 529-F
SHARES.

Purchase and Exchange of Shares

PURCHASE OF CLASS A, B AND C SHARES

You may generally open an account and purchase Class A, B and C shares by
contacting any investment dealer (who may impose transaction charges in addition
to those described in this prospectus) authorized to sell the fund's shares. You
may purchase additional shares in various ways, including through your
investment dealer and by mail, telephone, the Internet and bank wire.

PURCHASE OF CLASS F SHARES

You may generally open an account and purchase Class F shares only through
fee-based programs of investment firms that have special agreements with the
fund's distributor and certain registered investment advisers. These firms and
advisers typically charge ongoing fees for services they provide.

PURCHASE OF CLASS 529 SHARES

Class 529 shares may be purchased only through a CollegeAmerica account. You may
open a CollegeAmerica account and purchase 529 shares by contacting any
investment dealer (who may impose transaction charges in addition to those
described in this prospectus) authorized to sell a CollegeAmerica account. You
may purchase additional shares in various ways, including through your
investment dealer and by mail, telephone, the Internet and bank wire.

Class 529-E shares may only be purchased by employees participating in
CollegeAmerica through an eligible employer plan.

EXCHANGE

Generally, you may exchange your shares into shares of the same class of other
funds in The American Funds Group without a sales charge. Class A, C or F shares
may generally be exchanged into the corresponding 529 share class without a
sales charge. Class B shares may not be exchanged into Class 529-B shares.
EXCHANGES FROM CLASS A, C OR F SHARES TO THE CORRESPONDING 529 SHARE CLASS,
PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF UNIFORM GIFTS TO MINORS ACT OR UNIFORM TRANSFER TO
MINORS ACT CUSTODIAL ACCOUNTS, MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LEGAL AND TAX
CONSEQUENCES AS DESCRIBED IN THE COLLEGEAMERICA PROGRAM DESCRIPTION. PLEASE
CONSULT YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISER PRIOR TO MAKING SUCH AN EXCHANGE.

Exchanges of shares from the money market funds in The American Funds Group
initially purchased without a sales charge generally will be subject to the
appropriate sales charge. For purposes of computing the contingent deferred
sales charge on Class B and C shares, the length of time you have owned your
shares will be measured from the date of original purchase and will not be
affected by any permitted exchange.

Exchanges have the same tax consequences as ordinary sales and purchases.  For
example, to the extent you exchange shares held in a taxable account that are
worth more now than what you paid for them, the gain will be subject to
taxation.  See "Transactions by Telephone, Fax or the Internet" for information
regarding electronic exchanges.

VALUING SHARES

The net asset value of each share class of the fund is the value of a single
share. The fund calculates the net asset values, each day the New York Stock
Exchange is open, as of approximately 4:00 p.m. New York time, the normal close
of regular trading. Assets are valued primarily on the basis of market
quotations. However, the fund has adopted procedures for making "fair value"
determinations if market quotations are not readily available.

Your shares will be purchased at the net asset value (plus any applicable sales
charge in the case of Class A shares), or sold at the net asset value next
determined after American Funds Service Company receives and accepts your
request.  A contingent deferred sales charge may apply at the time you sell
certain Class A, B and C shares.

Sales Charges

CLASS A SHARES

The initial sales charge you pay when you buy Class A shares differs depending

as indicated below. Any applicable sales charge will be deducted directly from
your investment.

CLASS A PURCHASES NOT SUBJECT TO SALES CHARGE

INVESTMENTS OF $1 MILLION OR MORE MAY BE SUBJECT TO A 1% CONTINGENT DEFERRED
SALES CHARGE IF SHARES ARE SOLD WITHIN ONE YEAR OF PURCHASE. Employer-sponsored
defined contribution-type plans, including certain 403(b) plans, investing $1
million or more or with 100 or more eligible employees, and Individual
Retirement Account rollovers involving retirement plan assets invested in the
American Funds, may invest with no sales charge and are not subject to a
contingent deferred sales charge. Also exempt are investments made through
retirement plans, endowments or foundations with $50 million or more in assets,
and investments made through accounts that purchased fund shares before March
15, 2001 and are part of certain qualified fee-based programs. The distributor
may pay dealers up to 1% on investments made in Class A shares with no initial
sales charge. The fund may reimburse the distributor for these payments through
its Plans of Distribution (see below).

A transfer from the Virginia Prepaid Education Program or the Virginia Education
Savings Trust to a CollegeAmerica account will be made with no sales charge. No
commission will be paid to the dealer on such a transfer.

Certain other investors may qualify to purchase shares without a sales charge,
such as employees of broker-dealer firms and registered investment advisers
authorized to sell

American Funds, and employees of The Capital Group Companies. Please see the
statement of additional information for more information.

CLASS B AND C SHARES

Class B and C shares are sold without any initial sales charge. American Funds
Distributors pays 4% of the amount invested to dealers who sell Class B shares
and 1% to dealers who sell Class C shares.

For Class C shares, a contingent deferred sales charge of 1% applies if shares
are sold within one year of purchase. For Class B shares, a contingent deferred
sales charge may be applied to shares you sell within six years of purchase, as
shown in the table below.

Shares acquired through reinvestment of dividends or capital gain distributions
are not subject to a contingent deferred sales charge. In addition, the
contingent deferred sales charge may be waived in certain circumstances. See
"Contingent Deferred Sales Charge Waivers" below. The contingent deferred sales
charge is based on the original purchase cost or the current market value of the
shares being sold, whichever is less. For purposes of determining the contingent
deferred sales charge, if you sell only some of your shares, shares that are not
subject to any contingent deferred sales charge will be sold first, followed by
shares that you have owned the longest.

See "Plans of Distribution" below for ongoing compensation paid to your dealer
or financial adviser for all share classes.

CONVERSION OF CLASS B AND C SHARES

Class B shares automatically convert to Class A shares in the month of the
eight-year anniversary of the purchase date. Class C shares automatically
convert to Class F shares in the month of the ten-year anniversary of the
purchase date; however, Class 529-C shares will not convert to Class 529-F
shares. The Internal Revenue Service currently takes the position that these
automatic conversions are not taxable. Should its position change, the automatic
conversion feature may be suspended. If this happens, you would have the option
of converting your Class B, 529-B or C shares to the respective share classes at
the anniversary dates described above, but you may face certain tax consequences
as a result.

CLASS F AND 529-E SHARES

Class F and Class 529-E shares are sold without any initial or contingent
deferred sales charge.

Sales Charge Reductions and Waivers

TO RECEIVE A REDUCTION IN YOUR CLASS A INITIAL SALES CHARGE, YOU MUST LET YOUR
INVESTMENT DEALER OR AMERICAN FUNDS SERVICE COMPANY KNOW AT THE TIME YOU
PURCHASE SHARES THAT YOU QUALIFY FOR SUCH A REDUCTION. IF YOU DO NOT LET YOUR
DEALER OR AMERICAN FUNDS SERVICE COMPANY KNOW YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A REDUCTION,
YOU MAY NOT RECEIVE A SALES CHARGE DISCOUNT TO WHICH YOU ARE OTHERWISE ENTITLED.
To have your Class A, B or C contingent deferred sales charge waived, you must
let your investment dealer or American Funds Service Company know at the time
you redeem shares that you qualify for such a waiver.

REDUCING YOUR CLASS A INITIAL SALES CHARGE

Consistent with the policies described in this prospectus, you and your
"immediate family" (your spouse and your children under the age of 21) may
combine all of your American Funds and American Legacy investments to reduce
your Class A sales charge.

 AGGREGATING ACCOUNTS

 To receive a reduced Class A sales charge, investments made by you and your
 immediate family (see above) may be aggregated if made for your own account(s)
 and/or certain other accounts, such as:

 . trust accounts established by the above individuals. However, if the
  person(s) who established the trust is deceased, the trust account may be
  aggregated with accounts of the primary beneficiary of the trust;

 .solely controlled business accounts;

 .single-participant retirement plans.

 CONCURRENT PURCHASES

 You may combine simultaneous purchases of any class of shares of two or more
 American Funds, as well as individual holdings in various American Legacy
 variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies, to qualify for
 a reduced Class A sales charge. Direct purchases of money market funds are
 excluded.

 RIGHTS OF ACCUMULATION

 You may take into account the current value (or if greater, the amount you
 invested less any withdrawals) of your existing holdings in any class of shares
 of the American Funds, as well as individual holdings in various American
 Legacy variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies, to
 determine your Class A sales charge. Direct purchases of money market funds are
 excluded.

Fundamental Investors / Prospectus


<PAGE>

 STATEMENT OF INTENTION

 You may reduce your Class A sales charges by establishing a Statement of
 Intention. A Statement of Intention allows you to combine all non-money market
 fund purchases of all share classes you intend to make over a 13-month period,
 as well as individual holdings in various American Legacy variable annuity
 contracts and variable life insurance policies, to determine the applicable
 sales charge. At your request, purchases made during the previous 90 days may
 be included; however, capital appreciation and reinvested dividends and capital
 gains do not apply toward these combined purchases. A portion of your account
 may be held in escrow to cover additional Class A sales charges that may be due
 if your total investments over the 13-month period do not qualify for the
 applicable sales charge reduction.

CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE WAIVERS

The contingent deferred sales charge on Class A, B and C shares may be waived in
the following cases:

. permitted exchanges of shares, except if shares acquired by exchange are then
  redeemed within the period during which a contingent deferred sales charge
  would apply to the initial shares purchased;

. tax-free returns of excess contributions to IRAs;

. redemptions due to death or post-purchase disability of the shareholder (this
  generally excludes trusts);

. for 529 share classes only, redemptions due to a beneficiary's death,
  post-purchase disability or receipt of a scholarship (to the extent of the
  scholarship award);

. the following types of transactions, if together they do not exceed 12% of the
  value of an account annually:

 --redemptions due to receiving required minimum distributions from retirement
   accounts upon reaching age 70 1/2 (required minimum distributions that
   continue to be taken by the beneficiary(ies) after the account owner is
   deceased also qualify for a waiver); and

 --if you have established a systematic withdrawal plan, redemptions through
   such a plan (including any dividends and/or capital gain distributions taken
   in cash).

Plans of Distribution

The fund has Plans of Distribution or "12b-1 Plans" under which it may finance
activities primarily intended to sell shares, provided the categories of
expenses are approved in advance by the fund's board of directors. The plans
provide for annual expenses of up to 0.25% for Class A shares, up to 0.50% for
Class 529-A shares, 1.00% for Class B,
529-B, C and 529-C shares, up to 0.75% for Class 529-E shares, and up to 0.50%
for Class F and 529-F shares. For all share classes, up to 0.25% of these
expenses may be used to pay service fees to qualified dealers for providing
certain shareholder services.  The amount remaining for each share class may be
used for distribution expenses.

The 12b-1 fees paid by the fund, as a percentage of average net assets, for the
previous fiscal year are indicated earlier in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses
Table. Since these fees are paid out of the fund's assets or income on an
ongoing basis, over time they will increase the cost and reduce the return of an
investment. The higher fees for Class B and C shares may cost you more over time
than paying the initial sales charge for Class A shares.

OTHER COMPENSATION TO DEALERS

American Funds Distributors may pay, or sponsor informational meetings for,
dealers as described in the statement of additional information.

How to Sell Shares

You may sell (redeem) shares in any of the following ways:

 THROUGH YOUR DEALER OR FINANCIAL ADVISER (CERTAIN CHARGES MAY APPLY)

 . Shares held for you in your dealer's name must be sold through the dealer.

 . Class F shares must be sold through your dealer or financial adviser.

 WRITING TO AMERICAN FUNDS SERVICE COMPANY

 . Requests must be signed by the registered shareholder(s).

 . A signature guarantee is required if the redemption is:

  -- over $75,000;

  -- made payable to someone other than the registered shareholder(s); or

  -- sent to an address other than the address of record, or an address of
     record that has been changed within the last 10 days.

 . American Funds Service Company reserves the right to require signature
   guarantee(s) on any redemptions.

 . Additional documentation may be required for sales of shares held in
   corporate, partnership or fiduciary accounts.

 TELEPHONING OR FAXING AMERICAN FUNDS SERVICE COMPANY OR USING THE INTERNET

 . Redemptions by telephone, fax or the Internet (including American
   FundsLine(R) and American FundsLine OnLine(R)) are limited to $75,000 per
   American Funds shareholder each day.

 . Checks must be made payable to the registered shareholder.

 . Checks must be mailed to an address of record that has been used with the
   account for at least 10 days.

If you recently purchased shares and subsequently request a redemption of those
shares, you will receive proceeds from the redemption once a sufficient period
of time has passed to reasonably assure that checks or drafts (including
certified or cashiers' checks) for the shares purchased have cleared (normally
15 calendar days).

If you notify American Funds Service Company, you may reinvest proceeds from a
redemption, dividend payment or capital gain distribution without a sales charge
in any of the American Funds within 90 days after the date of the redemption or
distribution. Proceeds from a Class B share redemption where a contingent
deferred sales charge was charged will be reinvested in Class A shares. Proceeds
from any other type of redemption and all dividend payments and capital gain
distributions will be reinvested in the same share class from which the original
redemption or distribution was made. Any contingent deferred sales charge on
Class A or C shares will be credited to your account. Redemption proceeds of
Class A shares representing direct purchases in the money market funds that are
reinvested in non-money market funds will be subject to a sales charge. Proceeds
will

be reinvested at the next calculated net asset value after your request is
received and accepted by American Funds Service Company.

TRANSACTIONS BY TELEPHONE, FAX OR THE INTERNET

Generally, you are automatically eligible to use these services for redemptions
and exchanges unless you notify us in writing that you do not want any or all of
these services. You may reinstate these services at any time.

Unless you decide not to have telephone, fax or Internet services on your
account(s), you agree to hold the fund, American Funds Service Company, any of
its affiliates or mutual funds managed by such affiliates, and each of their
respective directors, trustees, officers, employees and agents harmless from any
losses, expenses, costs or liabilities (including attorney fees) which may be
incurred in connection with the exercise of these privileges, provided American
Funds Service Company employs reasonable procedures to confirm that the
instructions received from any person with appropriate account information are
genuine. If reasonable procedures are not employed, it and/or the fund may be
liable for losses due to unauthorized or fraudulent instructions.

Distributions and Taxes

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

The fund intends to distribute dividends to you, usually in February, May,
August and December. Capital gains, if any, are usually distributed in December
and February. When a dividend or capital gain is distributed, the net asset
value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment.

You may elect to reinvest dividends and/or capital gain distributions to
purchase additional shares of this fund or other American Funds, or you may
elect to receive them in cash. Most shareholders do not elect to take capital
gain distributions in cash because these distributions reduce principal value.
Dividends and capital gain distributions by 529 share classes will be
automatically reinvested.

TAXES ON DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Dividends and capital gain distributions you receive from the fund may be
subject to income tax and may also be subject to state or local taxes - unless
you are exempt from taxation.

For federal tax purposes, any taxable dividends and distributions of short-term
capital gains are treated as ordinary income. The fund's distributions of net
long-term capital gains are taxable to you as long-term capital gains. Any
taxable dividends or capital gain distributions you receive from the fund will
normally be taxable to you when made, regardless of whether you reinvest
dividends or capital gain distributions or receive them in cash.

TAXES ON TRANSACTIONS

Your redemptions, including exchanges, may result in a capital gain or loss for
federal tax purposes. A capital gain or loss on your investment is the
difference between the cost of your shares, including any sales charges, and the
price you receive when you sell them.

PLEASE SEE YOUR TAX ADVISER FOR MORE INFORMATION. HOLDERS OF 529 SHARES SHOULD
REFER TO THE COLLEGEAMERICA PROGRAM DESCRIPTION FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING
THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF SELLING 529 SHARES.

                 CERTAIN INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS AND GUIDELINES

The following limitations and guidelines are considered at the time of purchase,
under normal circumstances, and are based on a percentage of the fund's net
assets unless otherwise noted. This summary is not intended to reflect all of
the fund's investment limitations.


DEBT SECURITIES

.    The fund may invest up to 5% of its assets in straight debt securities
     (i.e, not convertible into equity) rated Ba or below by Moody's Investors
     Service, Inc. ("Moody's") and BB or below by Standard & Poor's Corporation
     ("S&P") or unrated but determined to be of equivalent quality.

NON-U.S. SECURITIES

.    The fund may invest up to 30% of its assets in securities of issuers that
     are domiciled outside the U.S. and not included in the S&P 500 Composite
     Index.

                      *     *     *     *     *     *

The fund may experience difficulty liquidating certain portfolio securities
during significant market declines or periods of heavy redemptions.


          DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT TECHNIQUES

The descriptions below are intended to supplement the material in the prospectus
under "Investment Objective, Strategies and Risks."


EQUITY SECURITIES - Equity securities represent an ownership position in a
company. These securities may include common stocks and securities with equity
conversion or purchase rights. The prices of equity securities fluctuate based
on changes in the financial condition of their issuers and on market and
economic conditions.


The growth-oriented, equity-type securities generally purchased by the fund may
involve large price swings and potential for loss.


DEBT SECURITIES - Debt securities are used by issuers to borrow money. Issuers
pay investors interest and generally must repay the amount borrowed at maturity.
Some debt securities, such as zero coupon bonds, do not pay current interest,
but are purchased at a discount from their face values. The prices of debt
securities fluctuate depending on such factors as interest rates, credit quality
and maturity. In general, prices of debt securities decline when interest rates
rise and increase when interest rates fall.


Lower rated debt securities, rated Ba or below by Moody's and BB or below by S&P
or unrated but determined to be of equivalent quality, are described by the
rating agencies as speculative and involve greater risk of default or price
changes due to changes in the issuer's creditworthiness than higher rated debt
securities, or they may already be in default. The market prices of these
securities may fluctuate more than higher quality securities and may decline
significantly in periods of general economic difficulty. It may be more
difficult to dispose of, or to determine the value of, lower rated debt
securities.

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 2
<PAGE>



Certain risk factors relating to debt securities are discussed below:


     SENSITIVITY TO INTEREST RATE AND ECONOMIC CHANGES - Debt securities may be
     sensitive to adverse economic changes and political and corporate
     developments and may be sensitive to interest rate changes. During an
     economic downturn or substantial period of rising interest rates, highly
     leveraged issuers may experience increased financial stress that would
     adversely affect their ability to service their principal and interest
     payment obligations, to meet projected business goals, and to obtain
     additional financing. In addition, periods of economic uncertainty and
     changes can be expected to result in increased volatility of market prices
     and yields of certain debt securities.

     PAYMENT EXPECTATIONS - Debt securities may contain redemption or call
     provisions. If an issuer exercises these provisions in a declining interest
     rate market, the fund would have to replace the security with a lower
     yielding security, resulting in a decreased return to investors. If the
     issuer of a debt security defaults on its obligations to pay interest or
     principal or enters into bankruptcy proceedings, the fund may incur losses
     or expenses in seeking recovery of amounts owed to it.

     LIQUIDITY AND VALUATION - There may be little trading in the secondary
     market for particular debt securities, which may affect adversely the
     fund's ability to value accurately or dispose of such debt securities.
     Adverse publicity and investor perceptions, whether or not based on
     fundamental analysis, may decrease the value and/or liquidity of debt
     securities.

The Investment Adviser attempts to reduce the risks described above through
diversification of the portfolio and by credit analysis of each issuer, as well
as by monitoring broad economic trends and corporate and legislative
developments, but there can be no assurance that it will be successful in doing
so.


SECURITIES WITH EQUITY AND DEBT CHARACTERISTICS - The fund may invest in
securities that have a combination of equity and debt characteristics. These
securities may at times behave more like equity than debt and vice versa. Some
types of convertible bonds or preferred stock automatically convert into common
stock. The prices and yields of non-convertible preferred stock generally move
with changes in interest rates and the issuer's credit quality, similar to the
factors affecting debt securities.


Convertible bonds, convertible preferred stock, and other securities may
sometimes be converted into common stock or other securities at a stated
conversion ratio. These securities, prior to conversion, pay a fixed rate of
interest or a dividend. Because convertible securities have both debt and equity
characteristics, their value varies in response to many factors, including the
value of the underlying assets, general market and economic conditions, and
convertible market valuations, as well as changes in interest rates, credit
spreads, and the credit quality of the issuer.


INVESTING IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES -  Investing outside the U.S. may involve special
risks, caused by, among other things: currency controls and fluctuating currency
values; different accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards
and practices in some countries; changing local, regional and global economic,
political, and social conditions; expropriation or confiscatory taxation;
greater market volatility; differing securities market structures; and various
administrative difficulties such as delays in clearing and settling portfolio
transactions or in

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 3
<PAGE>



receiving payment of dividends. However, in the opinion of the Investment
Adviser, investing outside the U.S. also can reduce certain portfolio risks due
to greater diversification opportunities.


The risks described above are potentially heightened in connection with
investments in developing countries. Although there is no universally accepted
definition, a developing country is generally considered to be a country in the
initial stages of its industrialization cycle with a low per capita gross
national product. For example, political and/or economic structures in these
countries may be in their infancy and developing rapidly. Historically, the
markets of developing countries have been more volatile than the markets of
developed countries. The fund may invest in securities of issuers in developing
countries only to a limited extent.


Additional costs could be incurred in connection with the fund's investment
activities outside the U.S. Brokerage commissions may be higher outside the
U.S., and the fund will bear certain expenses in connection with its currency
transactions. Furthermore, increased custodian costs may be associated with the
maintenance of assets in certain jurisdictions.


CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS - The fund can purchase and sell currencies to facilitate
securities transactions and enter into forward currency contracts to protect
against changes in currency exchange rates. A forward currency contract is an
obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date, which may
be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the
parties, at a price set at the time of the contract. Forward currency contracts
entered into by the fund will involve the purchase or sale of one currency
against the U.S. dollar. While entering into forward currency transactions could
minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged currency,
it could also limit any potential gain which might result from an increase in
the value of the currency. The fund will not generally attempt to protect
against all potential changes in exchange rates. The fund will segregate liquid
assets which will be marked to market daily to meet its forward contract
commitments to the extent required by the Securities and Exchange Commission.


Certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may affect the extent to which
the fund may enter into forward contracts. Such transactions may also affect the
character and timing of income, gain or loss recognized by the fund for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.


INVESTING IN SMALLER CAPITALIZATION STOCKS - The fund may invest in the stocks
of smaller capitalization companies (typically companies with market
capitalizations of less than $1.5 billion at the time of purchase). The
Investment Adviser believes that the issuers of smaller capitalization stocks
often provide attractive investment opportunities. However, investing in smaller
capitalization stocks can involve greater risk than is customarily associated
with investing in stocks of larger, more established companies. For example,
smaller companies often have limited product lines, markets, or financial
resources, may be dependent for management on one or a few key persons, and can
be more susceptible to losses. Also, their securities may be thinly traded (and
therefore have to be sold at a discount from current prices or sold in small
lots over an extended period of time), may be followed by fewer investment
research analysts, and may be subject to wider price swings, thus creating a
greater chance of loss than securities of larger capitalization companies.


U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES - U.S. Treasury securities include direct obligations
of the U.S. Treasury, such as Treasury bills, notes and bonds. For these
securities, the payment of principal and interest is unconditionally guaranteed
by the U.S. government, and thus they are of the

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 4
<PAGE>



highest possible credit quality. Such securities are subject to variations in
market value due to fluctuations in interest rates, but, if held to maturity,
will be paid in full.


U.S. AGENCY SECURITIES - U.S. agency securities include those securities issued
by certain U.S. government instrumentalities and certain federal agencies. These
securities are neither direct obligations of, nor guaranteed by, the Treasury.
However, they generally involve some form of federal sponsorship: some are
backed by specific types of collateral; some are supported by the issuer's right
to borrow from the Treasury; some are supported by the discretionary authority
of the Treasury to purchase certain obligations of the issuer; and others are
supported only by the credit of the issuing government agency or
instrumentality. These agencies and instrumentalities include, but are not
limited to: Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
("Freddie Mac"), Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae"), Tennessee
Valley Authority, and Federal Farm Credit Bank System.


CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - These include: (i) commercial paper (e.g.,
short-term notes up to 9 months in maturity issued by corporations, governmental
bodies or bank/corporation sponsored conduits (asset-backed commercial paper)),
(ii) commercial bank obligations (e.g., certificates of deposit, bankers'
acceptances (time drafts on a commercial bank where the bank accepts an
irrevocable obligation to pay at maturity)), (iii) savings association and
savings bank obligations (e.g., bank notes and certificates of deposit issued by
savings banks or savings associations), (iv) securities of the U.S. government,
its agencies or instrumentalities that mature, or may be redeemed, in one year
or less, and (v) corporate bonds and notes that mature, or that may be redeemed,
in one year or less.


REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS - The fund may enter into repurchase agreements under
which the fund buys a security and obtains a simultaneous commitment from the
seller to repurchase the security at a specified time and price. Repurchase
agreements permit the fund to maintain liquidity and earn income over periods of
time as short as overnight. The seller must maintain with the fund's custodian
collateral equal to at least 100% of the repurchase price, including accrued
interest, as monitored daily by the Investment Adviser. The fund will only enter
into repurchase agreements involving securities in which it could otherwise
invest and with selected banks and securities dealers whose financial condition
is monitored by the Investment Adviser. If the seller under the repurchase
agreement defaults, the fund may incur a loss if the value of the collateral
securing the repurchase agreement has declined and may incur disposition costs
in connection with liquidating the collateral. If bankruptcy proceedings are
commenced with respect to the seller, realization of the collateral by the fund
may be delayed or limited.


RESTRICTED SECURITIES AND LIQUIDITY - The fund may purchase securities subject
to restrictions on resale. Securities not actively traded will be considered
illiquid unless they have been specifically determined to be liquid under
procedures adopted by the fund's Board of Directors, taking into account factors
such as the frequency and volume of trading, the commitment of dealers to make
markets and the availability of qualified investors, all of which can change
from time to time. The fund may incur certain additional costs in disposing of
illiquid securities.

                        *     *     *     *     *     *

PORTFOLIO TURNOVER - Portfolio changes will be made without regard to the length
of time particular investments may have been held. Short-term trading profits
are not the fund's objective, and changes in its investments are generally
accomplished gradually, though short-term transactions may occasionally be made.
High portfolio turnover (100% or more) involves

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 5
<PAGE>


correspondingly greater transaction costs in the form of dealer spreads or
brokerage commissions, and may result in the realization of net capital gains,
which are taxable when distributed to shareholders.


A fund's portfolio turnover rate would equal 100% if each security in the fund's
portfolio was replaced once per year. The fund's portfolio turnover rate for the
fiscal year ended 2002 was 38%. See "Financial Highlights" in the prospectus for
the fund's annual portfolio turnover for each of the last five fiscal periods.



                FUNDAMENTAL POLICIES AND INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS

FUNDAMENTAL POLICIES - The fund has adopted the following fundamental policies
and investment restrictions which may not be changed without approval by holders
of a majority of its outstanding shares. Such majority is defined in the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as the vote of the
lesser of (i) 67% or more of the outstanding voting securities present at a
meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities
are present in person or by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding
voting securities. All percentage limitations are considered at the time
securities are purchased and are based on the fund's net assets unless otherwise
indicated. None of the following investment restrictions involving a maximum
percentage of assets will be considered violated unless the excess occurs
immediately after, and is caused by, an acquisition by the fund.


The fund may not:


1.    borrow money or securities;

2.    buy securities "on margin";

3.    effect "short sales" of securities;

4.    mortgage, pledge or hypothecate securities;

5.    lend money or securities (but the purchase of a portion of an issue of
publicly distributed debt securities is not considered the making of a loan);

6.    invest in the securities of any issuer which, including predecessors, has
a record of less than three years continuous operation;

7.    invest in the securities of any issuer if any officer or director of the
fund owns more than 1/2 of 1% of the securities of that issuer or if the fund's
officers and directors together own more than 5% of the securities of that
issuer;

8.    invest any of its assets in the securities of any managed investment trust
or of any other managed investment company;

9.    invest more than 5% of its total assets at the market value at the time of
investment in securities of any one issuer, or hold more than 10% of such
securities of any one issuer, but these limitations do not apply to obligations
of or guaranteed by the U.S.;

10.   purchase or sell real estate;

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 6
<PAGE>


11.   purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts;

12.   act as underwriter of securities issued by other persons;

13.  make investments in other companies for the purpose of exercising control
or management;

14.   concentrate its investments in any one industry or group of industries,
but may invest up to 25% of its assets in any one industry.

Notwithstanding investment restriction number 8, the fund may invest in
securities of other investment companies if deemed advisable by its officers in
connection with the administration of a deferred compensation plan adopted by
Directors pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.


For purposes of investment restriction number 14, the fund will not invest 25%
or more (rather than more than 25%) of its total assets in the securities of
issuers in the same industry.


Although not fundamental policies, the fund has further agreed that it will not
invest in puts or calls; or invest more than 10% of the value of its total
assets in securities which are not readily marketable (including repurchase
agreements maturing in more than seven days or securities for which there is no
active and substantial market).


No officer or director of the fund may sell portfolio securities to the fund or
buy portfolio securities from it.

1 Amounts may be deferred by eligible Directors under a non-qualified deferred
  compensation plan adopted by the fund in 1993. Deferred amounts accumulate at
  an earnings rate determined by the total return of one or more funds in The
  American Funds Group as designated by the Directors.

2 Capital Research and Management Company manages the American Funds, consisting
  of 29 funds. Capital Research and Management Company also manages American
  Funds Insurance Series and Anchor Pathway Fund, which serve as the underlying

  whose shareholders are limited to certain non-profit organizations.
3 Since the deferred compensation plan's adoption, the total amount of deferred

  fiscal year for participating Directors is as follows: Guilford C. Babcock
  ($167,398), Robert A. Fox ($83,025), John G. McDonald ($125,107), Gail L.
  Neale ($12,531), Henry E. Riggs ($197,764) and Patricia K. Woolf ($21,843).
  Amounts deferred and accumulated earnings thereon are not funded and are
  general unsecured liabilities of the fund until paid to the Directors.

As of February 1, 2003, the officers and Directors of the fund and their
families, as a group, owned beneficially or of record less than 1% of the
outstanding shares of the fund.


FUND ORGANIZATION AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The fund, an open-end, diversified management investment company, was organized
as a Delaware corporation on October 17, 1932 and reincorporated in Maryland on
February 1, 1990. All fund operations are supervised by the fund's Board of
Directors, which meets periodically and performs duties required by applicable
state and federal laws.


Under Maryland law, the business and affairs of the fund are managed under the
direction of the Board of Directors, and all powers of the fund are exercised by
or under the authority of the Board except as reserved to the shareholders by
law or the fund's charter or by-laws. Maryland law requires each Director to
perform his/her duties as a Director, including his/her duties as a member of
any Board committee on which he/she serves, in good faith, in a manner he/she
reasonably believes to be in the best interest of the fund, and with the care
that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar
circumstances.


Members of the Board who are not employed by Capital Research and Management
Company or its affiliates are paid certain fees for services rendered to the
fund as described above. They may elect to defer all or a portion of these fees
through a deferred compensation plan in effect for the fund.

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 13
<PAGE>



The fund has several different classes of shares, including classes A, B, C, F,
529-A, 529-B, 529-C, 529-E, 529-F, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4 and R-5. The 529 share
classes are available only through CollegeAmerica to investors establishing
qualified higher education savings accounts. The R share classes are generally
available only to retirement plans. Class R-5 shares are also available to
clients of the Personal Investment Management Group of Capital Guardian Trust
Company who do not have an intermediary associated with their accounts and
without regard to the $1 million purchase minimum.  The R share classes are
described in more detail in the fund's Retirement Plan Statement of Additional
Information.


The shares of each class represent an interest in the same investment portfolio.
Each class has pro rata rights as to voting, redemption, dividends and
liquidation, except that each class bears different distribution expenses and
may bear different transfer agent fees and other expenses properly attributable
to the particular class as approved by the Board of Directors and set forth in
the fund's rule 18f-3 Plan. Each class' shareholders have exclusive voting
rights with respect to the respective class' rule 12b-1 Plans adopted in
connection with the distribution of shares and on other matters in which the
interests of one class are different from interests in another class. Shares of
all classes of the fund vote together on matters that affect all classes in
substantially the same manner. Each class votes as a class on matters that
affect that class alone. Note that CollegeAmerica account owners are not
shareholders of the fund and accordingly, do not have the rights of a
shareholder, such as the right to vote proxies relating to fund shares. As the
legal owner of the fund's shares, the Virginia College Savings Plan will vote
any proxies relating to fund shares.


The fund does not hold annual meetings of shareholders. However, significant
matters which require shareholder approval, such as certain elections of Board
members or a change in a fundamental investment policy, will be presented to
shareholders at a meeting called for such purpose. Shareholders have one vote
per share owned. At the request of the holders of at least 10% of the shares,
the fund will hold a meeting at which any member of the Board could be removed
by a majority vote.


COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The fund has an Audit Committee comprised of Guilford C. Babcock, Robert A. Fox,
Leonade D. Jones and John G. McDonald, none of whom is considered an "interested
person" of the fund within the meaning of the 1940 Act. The Committee oversees
the fund's accounting and financial reporting policies and practices, its
internal controls and the internal controls of the fund's principal service
providers. The Committee acts as a liaison between the fund's independent
auditors and the full Board of Directors. Two Audit Committee meetings were held
during the 2002 fiscal year.


The fund has a Contracts Committee comprised of Guilford C. Babcock, Robert A.
Fox, Leonade D. Jones, John G. McDonald, Gail L. Neale, Henry E. Riggs and
Patricia K. Woolf, none of whom is considered an "interested person" of the fund
within the meaning of the 1940 Act. The Committee's function is to request,
review and consider the information deemed necessary to evaluate the terms of
certain agreements between the fund and its Investment Adviser or the Investment
Adviser's affiliates, such as the Investment Advisory and Service Agreement,
Principal Underwriting Agreement, Administrative Services Agreement and Plans of
Distribution under rule 12b-1, that the fund may enter into, renew or continue,
and to make its recommendations to the full Board of Directors on these matters.
One Contracts Committee meeting was held during the 2002 fiscal year.

The fund has a Nominating Committee comprised of Guilford C. Babcock, Robert A.
Fox, Leonade D. Jones, Gail L. Neale and Patricia K. Woolf, none of whom is
considered an "interested person" of the fund within the meaning of the 1940
Act. The Committee periodically reviews such issues as the Board's composition,
responsibilities, committees, compensation and other relevant issues, and
recommends any appropriate changes to the full Board of Directors. The Committee
also evaluates, selects and nominates independent director candidates to the
full Board of Directors. While the Committee normally is able to identify from
its own resources an ample number of qualified candidates, it will consider
shareholder suggestions of persons to be considered as nominees to fill future
vacancies on the Board.  Such suggestions must be sent in writing to the
Nominating Committee of the fund, c/o the fund's Secretary, and must be
accompanied by complete biographical and occupational data on the prospective
nominee, along with a written consent of the prospective nominee for
consideration of his or her name by the Committee. No Nominating Committee
meetings were held during the 2002 fiscal year.


The fund has a Proxy Committee comprised of Robert A. Fox, Leonade D. Jones,
John G. McDonald, Henry E. Riggs and Patricia K. Woolf, none of whom is
considered an "interested person" of the fund within the meaning of the 1940
Act. The Committee's functions include establishing and reviewing procedures and
policies for voting of proxies of companies held in the fund's portfolio, making
determinations with regard to certain contested proxy voting issues, and
discussing related current issues. Four Proxy Committee meetings were held
during the 2002 fiscal year.


INVESTMENT ADVISER - The Investment Adviser, Capital Research and Management
Company, founded in 1931, maintains research facilities in the U.S. and abroad
(Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington, D.C., London, Geneva, Hong
Kong, Singapore and Tokyo) with a staff of professionals, many of whom have
significant investment experience. The Investment Adviser is located at 333
South Hope Street, Los Angeles, CA 90071, and at 135 South State College
Boulevard, Brea, CA 92821. The Investment Adviser's research professionals
travel several million miles a year, making more than 5,000 research visits in
more than 50 countries around the world. The Investment Adviser believes that it
is able to attract and retain quality personnel. The Investment Adviser is a
wholly owned subsidiary of The Capital Group Companies, Inc.


The Investment Adviser is responsible for managing more than $350 billion of
stocks, bonds and money market instruments and serves over 11 million
shareholder accounts of all types throughout the world. These investors include
individuals, privately owned businesses and large corporations as well as
schools, colleges, foundations and other non-profit and tax-exempt
organizations.


INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND SERVICE AGREEMENT - The Investment Advisory and Service
Agreement (the "Agreement") between the fund and the Investment Adviser will
continue in effect until August 31, 2003, unless sooner terminated, and may be
renewed from year to year thereafter, provided that any such renewal has been
specifically approved at least annually by (i) the Board of Directors, or by the
vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting
securities of the fund, and (ii) the vote of a majority of Directors who are not
parties to the Agreement or interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of
any such party, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on
such approval. The Agreement provides that the Investment Adviser has no
liability to the fund for its acts or omissions in the performance of its
obligations to the fund not involving willful misconduct, bad faith, gross
negligence or reckless disregard of its obligations under the Agreement. The
Agreement also

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 15
<PAGE>



provides that either party has the right to terminate it, without penalty, upon
60 days' written notice to the other party, and that the Agreement automatically
terminates in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).


In determining whether to renew the Agreement each year, the Contracts Committee
of the Board of Directors evaluates information provided by the Investment
Adviser in accordance with Section 15(c) of the 1940 Act, and presents its
recommendations to the full Board of Directors. At its most recent meeting, the
Committee reviewed and considered a number of factors in recommending renewal of
the existing Agreement, including the quality of services provided to the fund
(primarily measured by investment results), fees and expenses borne by the fund,
financial results of the Investment Adviser (including comparisons to a group of
publicly held mutual fund managers) and comparative data for other mutual funds
and selected indexes.


In reviewing the quality of the services provided to the fund, the Committee
noted, among other things, that while the fund's results for 2001 were favorable
in relation to some peer groups but not others, the fund's results compared
favorably to all relevant peer groups for the five- and ten-year periods ended
March 31, 2002. The Committee also considered the overall high quality and depth
of the Investment Adviser's organization in general and of the individuals
providing portfolio research and management services to the fund. In addition,
the Committee noted the Investment Adviser's continuing financial strength and
stability.


In reviewing the fees and expenses borne by the fund, the Committee noted, among
other things, that the fund's advisory fees as a percentage of its average net
assets had declined consistently since 1992, and that such fees for 2001
compared favorably to the fund's peer group. While observing that the fund's
total expenses for 2001 (as a percentage of average net assets) also compared
favorably to the relevant peer group, the Committee noted a general growth trend
in transfer agency expenses due in large part to an increase in the number of
shareholder transactions.


Based on their review, the Committee and the Board concluded that the advisory
fees and expenses of the fund are fair, both absolutely and in comparison with
those of other funds in the industry, and that shareholders have received
reasonable value in return for paying fees and expenses.


The Investment Adviser, in addition to providing investment advisory services,
furnishes the services and pays the compensation and travel expenses of persons
to perform the executive, administrative, clerical and bookkeeping functions of
the fund, and provides suitable office space, necessary small office equipment
and utilities, general purpose accounting forms, supplies, and postage used at
the offices of the fund. The fund pays all expenses not assumed by the
Investment Adviser, including, but not limited to: custodian, stock transfer and
dividend disbursing fees and expenses; shareholder recordkeeping and
administrative expenses; costs of the designing, printing and mailing of
reports, prospectuses, proxy statements, and notices to its shareholders; taxes;
expenses of the issuance and redemption of shares of the fund (including stock
certificates, registration and qualification fees and expenses); expenses
pursuant to the fund's Plans of Distribution (described below); legal and
auditing expenses; compensation, fees and expenses paid to Directors
unaffiliated with the Investment Adviser; association dues; costs of stationery
and forms prepared exclusively for the fund; and costs of assembling and storing
shareholder account data.

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 16
<PAGE>



As compensation for its services, the Investment Adviser receives a monthly fee
which is based on average daily net assets and is calculated at an annual rate
of 0.39% on the first $1 billion of the fund's net assets, plus 0.336% on net
assets over $1 billion to $2 billion, plus 0.30% on net assets over $2 billion
to $3 billion, plus 0.276% on net assets over $3 billion to $5 billion, plus
0.27% on net assets over $5 billion to $8 billion, plus 0.258% on net assets
over $8 billion to $13 billion, plus 0.252% on net assets over $13 billion to
$17 billion, plus 0.250% on net assets over $17 billion to $21 billion, plus
0.248% on net assets over $21 billion to $27 billion, plus 0.246% on net assets
over $27 billion.


In connection with the approval of the Agreement by the fund's Board of
Directors, the Investment Adviser has agreed to waive any fees to the extent
they would exceed those payable under the rate structure contained in its
previous agreement. The fee structure referenced above is lower than that in the
previous agreement except in the event that the fund's net assets were to fall
below $8 billion when fees are equal to, or higher than, that in the previous
agreement.


The Agreement provides for a management fee reduction to the extent that the
annual ordinary operating expenses of the fund's Class A shares exceed 1% of the
average net assets in excess thereof. Expenses which are not subject to these
limitations are interest, taxes, and extraordinary expenses. Expenditures,
including costs incurred in connection with the purchase or sale of portfolio
securities, which are capitalized in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles applicable to investment companies are accounted for as
capital items and not as expenses. To the extent the fund's management fee must
be waived due to Class A share expense ratios exceeding this limit, management
fees will be reduced similarly for all classes of shares of the fund or other
Class A fees will be waived in lieu of management fees.


For the fiscal years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Investment Adviser received
from the fund advisory fees of $51,014,000, $54,760,000 and $51,298,000,
respectively.


ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES AGREEMENT - The Administrative Services Agreement (the
"Administrative Agreement") between the fund and the Investment Adviser relating
to the fund's Class C, F and 529 shares will continue in effect until August 31,
2003, unless sooner terminated, and may be renewed from year to year thereafter,
provided that any such renewal has been specifically approved at least annually
by the vote of a majority of Directors who are not parties to the Administrative
Agreement or interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of any such party,
cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval.
 The Administrative Agreement provides that the fund may terminate the agreement
at any time by vote of a majority of Directors who are not interested persons of
the fund.  The Investment Adviser has the right to terminate the Administrative
Agreement upon 60 days' written notice to the fund. The Administrative Agreement
automatically terminates in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940
Act).


Under the Administrative Agreement, the Investment Adviser provides certain
transfer agent and administrative services for shareholders of the fund's Class
C and F shares, and all Class 529 shares.  The Investment Adviser contracts with
third parties, including American Funds Service Company, the fund's Transfer
Agent, to provide these services.  Services include, but are not limited to,
shareholder account maintenance, transaction processing, tax information
reporting, and shareholder and fund communications. In addition, the Investment
Adviser monitors, coordinates and oversees the activities performed by third
parties providing such services.

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 17
<PAGE>



As compensation for its services, the Investment Adviser receives transfer agent
fees for transfer agent services provided to the fund's applicable share
classes.  Transfer agent fees are paid monthly according to a fee schedule
contained in a Shareholder Services Agreement between the fund and American
Funds Service Company. The Investment Adviser also receives an administrative
services fee for administrative services provided to the fund's applicable share
classes.  Administrative services fees are paid monthly, accrued daily and
calculated at the annual rate of 0.15% of the average daily net assets of each
respective applicable share class.


During the fiscal period ended 2002, administrative services fees paid by the
fund were:

The fund has adopted Plans of Distribution (the "Plans") pursuant to rule 12b-1
under the 1940 Act. The Principal Underwriter receives amounts payable pursuant
to the Plans (see below). As required by rule 12b-1 and the 1940 Act, the Plans
(together with the Principal Underwriting Agreement) have been approved by the
full Board of Directors and separately by a majority of the Directors who are
not "interested persons" of the fund and who have no direct or indirect
financial interest in the operation of the Plans or the Principal Underwriting
Agreement. Potential benefits of the Plans to the fund include: shareholder
services; savings to the fund in transfer agency costs; savings to the fund in
advisory fees and other expenses; benefits to the investment process from growth
or stability of assets; and maintenance of a financially healthy management
organization. The selection and nomination of Directors who are not "interested
persons" of the fund are committed to the discretion of the Directors who are
not "interested persons" during the existence of the Plans. The Plans may not be
amended to increase materially the amount spent for distribution without
shareholder approval. Plan expenses are reviewed quarterly and the Plans must be
renewed annually by the Board of Directors.


Under the Plans, the fund may annually expend the following amounts to finance
any activity primarily intended to result in the sale of fund shares, provided
the fund's Board of Directors has approved the category of expenses for which
payment is being made: (i) for Class A shares, up to 0.25% of the average daily
net assets attributable to Class A shares; (ii) for Class 529-A shares, up to
0.50% of the average daily net assets attributable to Class 529-A shares; (iii)
for Class B and 529-B shares, 1.00% of the average daily net assets attributable
to Class B and 529-B shares, respectively; (iv) for Class C and 529-C shares,
1.00% of the average daily net assets attributable to Class C and 529-C shares,
respectively; (v) for Class 529-E shares, up to 0.75% of the average daily net
assets attributable to Class 529-E shares; and (vi) for Class F and 529-F
shares, up to 0.50% of the average daily net assets attributable to Class F and
529-F shares, respectively.

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 19
<PAGE>



For Class A and 529-A shares: (i) up to 0.25% is reimbursed to the Principal
Underwriter for paying service-related expenses, including service fees paid to
qualified dealers, and (ii) up to the amount allowable under the fund's Class A
and 529-A 12b-1 limit is reimbursed to the Principal Underwriter for paying
distribution-related expenses, including for Class A and 529-A shares dealer
commissions and wholesaler compensation paid on sales of shares of $1 million or
more purchased without a sales charge (including purchases by employer-sponsored
defined contribution-type retirement plans investing $1 million or more or with
100 or more eligible employees, and retirement plans, endowments and foundations
with $50 million or more in assets) ("no load purchases"). Commissions on no
load purchases of Class A and 529-A shares, in excess of the Class A and 529-A
Plan limitations not reimbursed to the Principal Underwriter during the most
recent fiscal quarter are recoverable for five quarters, provided that such
commissions do not exceed the annual expense limit.  After five quarters these
commissions are not recoverable.


For Class B and 529-B shares: (i) 0.25% is paid to the Principal Underwriter for
paying service-related expenses, including service fees paid to qualified
dealers, and (ii) 0.75% is paid to the Principal Underwriter for
distribution-related expenses, including the financing of commissions paid to
qualified dealers.


For Class C and 529-C shares: (i) 0.25% is paid to the Principal Underwriter for
paying service-related expenses, including paying service fees paid to qualified
dealers, and (ii) 0.75% is paid to the Principal Underwriter for paying
distribution-related expenses, including commissions paid to qualified dealers.


For Class 529-E shares: (i) 0.25% is paid to the Principal Underwriter for
paying service-related expenses, including paying service fees paid to qualified
dealers, and (ii) 0.25% is paid to the Principal Underwriter for paying
distribution-related expenses, including commissions paid to qualified dealers.


For Class F and 529-F shares, 0.25% is paid to the Principal Underwriter for
paying service-related expenses, including service fees paid to qualified
dealers or advisers.  Currently, no compensation is paid under the fund's Class
F and 529-F Plans for distribution-related expenses.

OTHER COMPENSATION TO DEALERS - The Principal Underwriter, at its expense (from
a designated percentage of its income), currently provides additional
compensation to dealers. Currently, these payments are limited to the top 100
dealers who have sold shares of the fund or other funds in The American Funds
Group. These payments are based principally on a pro rata share of a qualifying
dealer's sales. The Principal Underwriter will, on an annual basis, determine
the advisability of continuing these payments.

                            TAXES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

FUND TAXATION - The fund has elected to be treated as a regulated investment
company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). A
regulated investment company qualifying under Subchapter M of the Code is
required to distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its investment
company taxable income (including the excess of net short-term capital gain over
net long-term capital losses) and generally is not subject to federal income tax
to the extent that it distributes annually 100% of its investment company
taxable income and net realized capital gains in the manner required under the
Code. The fund intends to distribute annually all of its investment company
taxable income and net realized capital gains and therefore does not expect to
pay federal income tax, although in certain circumstances the fund may determine
that it is in the interest of shareholders to distribute less than that amount.



To be treated as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Code,
the fund must also (a) derive at least 90% of its gross income from dividends,
interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or
other disposition of securities or foreign currencies, or other income
(including, but not limited to, gains from options, futures or forward
contracts) derived with respect to the business of investing in such securities
or currencies, and (b) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each fiscal
quarter, (i) at least 50% of the market value of the fund's assets is
represented by cash, U.S. government securities and securities of other
regulated investment companies, and other securities (for purposes of this
calculation, generally limited in respect of any one issuer, to an amount not
greater than 5% of the market

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 21
<PAGE>


value of the fund's assets and 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such
issuer) and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of its assets is invested in the
securities of any one issuer (other than U.S. government securities or the
securities of other regulated investment companies), or two or more issuers
which the fund controls and which are determined to be engaged in the same or
similar trades or businesses.


Under the Code, a nondeductible excise tax of 4% is imposed on the excess of a
regulated investment company's "required distribution" for the calendar year
ending within the regulated investment company's taxable year over the
"distributed amount" for such calendar year. The term "required distribution"
means the sum of (i) 98% of ordinary income (generally net investment income)
for the calendar year, (ii) 98% of capital gain (both long-term and short-term)
for the one-year period ending on October 31 (as though the one-year period
ending on October 31 were the regulated investment company's taxable year), and
(iii) the sum of any untaxed, undistributed net investment income and net
capital gains of the regulated investment company for prior periods. The term
"distributed amount" generally means the sum of (i) amounts actually distributed
by the fund from its current year's ordinary income and capital gain net income
and (ii) any amount on which the fund pays income tax during the periods
described above. Although the fund intends to distribute its net investment
income and net capital gains so as to avoid excise tax liability, the fund may
determine that it is the interest of shareholders to distribute a lesser amount.


The following information may not apply to you if you hold fund shares in a
non-taxable account, such as a qualified retirement plan. Please see your tax
adviser for more information.


DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAIN DISTRIBUTIONS - Dividends and capital gain
distributions on fund shares will be reinvested in shares of the fund of the
same class, unless shareholders indicate in writing that they wish to receive
them in cash or in shares of the same class of other American Funds, as provided
in the prospectus. Dividends and capital gain distributions by 529 share classes
will be automatically reinvested.


Distributions of investment company taxable income and net realized capital
gains to individual shareholders will be taxable whether received in shares or
in cash. Shareholders electing to receive distributions in the form of
additional shares will have a cost basis for federal income tax purposes in each
share so received equal to the net asset value of that share on the reinvestment
date.


     DIVIDENDS - The fund intends to follow the practice of distributing
     substantially all of its investment company taxable income, which includes
     any excess of net realized short-term gains over net realized long-term
     capital losses.  Investment company taxable income generally includes
     dividends, interest, net short-term capital gains in excess of net
     long-term capital losses, and certain foreign currency gains, if any, less
     expenses and certain foreign currency losses.

     Under the Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange
     rates which occur between the time the fund accrues receivables or
     liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time the fund
     actually collects such receivables, or pays such liabilities, generally are
     treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss. Similarly, on disposition of
     debt securities denominated in a foreign currency and on disposition of
     certain futures contracts, forward contracts and options, gains or losses
     attributable to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency between the
     date of acquisition of the security or contract and

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 22
<PAGE>



     the date of disposition are also treated as ordinary gain or loss. These
     gains or losses, referred to under the Code as "Section 988" gains or
     losses, may increase or decrease the amount of the fund's investment
     company taxable income to be distributed to its shareholders as ordinary
     income.


     If the fund invests in stock of certain passive foreign investment
     companies, the fund may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation on a
     portion of any "excess distribution" with respect to, or gain from the
     disposition of, such stock. The tax would be determined by allocating such
     distribution or gain ratably to each day of the fund's holding period for
     the stock. The distribution or gain so allocated to any taxable year of the
     fund, other than the taxable year of the excess distribution or
     disposition, would be taxed to the fund at the highest ordinary income rate
     in effect for such year, and the tax would be further increased by an
     interest charge to reflect the value of the tax deferral deemed to have
     resulted from the ownership of the foreign company's stock. Any amount of
     distribution or gain allocated to the taxable year of the distribution or
     disposition would be included in the fund's investment company taxable
     income and, accordingly, would not be taxable to the fund to the extent
     distributed by the fund as a dividend to its shareholders.


     To avoid such tax and interest, the fund intends to elect to treat these
     securities as sold on the last day of its fiscal year and recognize any
     gains for tax purposes at that time. Under this election, deductions for
     losses are allowable only to the extent of any prior recognized gains, and
     both gains and losses will be treated as ordinary income or loss. The fund
     will be required to distribute any resulting income, even though it has not
     sold the security and received cash to pay such distributions.  Upon
     disposition of these securities, any gain recognized is treated as ordinary
     income and loss is treated as ordinary loss to the extent of any prior
     recognized gain.


     Dividends from domestic corporations are expected to comprise some portion
     of the fund's gross income. To the extent that such dividends constitute
     any of the fund's gross income, a portion of the income distributions of
     the fund will be eligible for the deduction for dividends received by
     corporations. Shareholders will be informed of the portion of dividends
     which so qualify. The dividends-received deduction is reduced to the extent
     that either the fund shares, or the underlying shares of stock held by the
     fund, with respect to which dividends are received, are treated as
     debt-financed under federal income tax law and is eliminated if the shares
     are deemed to have been held by the shareholder or the fund, as the case
     may be, for less than 46 days during the 90-day period beginning on the
     date which is 45 days before the date on which the shares become
     ex-dividend. Capital gain distributions are not eligible for the
     dividends-received deduction.


     A portion of the difference between the issue price of zero coupon
     securities and their face value ("original issue discount") is considered
     to be income to the fund each year, even though the fund will not receive
     cash interest payments from these securities.  This original issue discount
     (imputed income) will comprise a part of the investment company taxable
     income of the fund which must be distributed to shareholders in order to
     maintain the qualification of the fund as a regulated investment company
     and to avoid federal income taxation at the level of the fund.


     In addition, some of the bonds may be purchased by the fund at a discount
     that exceeds the original issue discount on such bonds, if any.  This
     additional discount represents market discount for federal income tax
     purposes.  The gain realized on the disposition of

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 23
<PAGE>



     any bond having a market discount may be treated as taxable ordinary income
     to the extent it does not exceed the accrued market discount on such bond
     or a fund may elect to include the market discount in income in tax years
     to which it is attributable.  Generally, accrued market discount may be
     figured under either the ratable accrual method or constant interest
     method.  If the fund has paid a premium over the face amount of a bond, the
     fund has the option of either amortizing the premium until bond maturity
     and reducing the fund's basis in the bond by the amortized amount, or not
     amortizing and treating the premium as part of the bond's basis. In the
     case of any debt security having a fixed maturity date of not more than one
     year from its date of issue, the gain realized on disposition generally
     will be treated as a short-term capital gain. In general, any gain realized
     on disposition of a security held less than one year is treated as a
     short-term capital gain.


     Dividend and interest income received by the fund from sources outside the
     U.S. may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by such foreign
     jurisdictions. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may
     reduce or eliminate these foreign taxes, however. Most foreign countries do
     not impose taxes on capital gains in respect of investments by foreign
     investors.


     CAPITAL GAIN DISTRIBUTIONS - The fund also intends to follow the practice
     of distributing the entire excess of net realized long-term capital gains
     over net realized short-term capital losses. Net capital gains for a fiscal
     year are computed by taking into account any capital loss carry-forward of
     the fund.

     If any net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital
     losses are retained by the fund for reinvestment, requiring federal income
     taxes to be paid thereon by the fund, the fund intends to elect to treat
     such capital gains as having been distributed to shareholders. As a result,
     each shareholder will report such capital gains as long-term capital gains
     taxable to individual shareholders at a maximum 20% capital gains rate,
     will be able to claim a pro rata share of federal income taxes paid by the
     fund on such gains as a credit against personal federal income tax
     liability, and will be entitled to increase the adjusted tax basis on fund
     shares by the difference between a pro rata share of the retained gains and
     such shareholder's related tax credit.


SHAREHOLDER TAXATION - In January of each year, individual shareholders of the
fund will receive a statement of the federal income tax status of all
distributions. Shareholders of the fund also may be subject to state and local
taxes on distributions received from the fund. Distributions of the excess of
net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses which the fund
properly designates as "capital gain dividends" generally will be taxable to
individual shareholders at a maximum 20% capital gains rate, regardless of the
length of time the shares of the fund have been held by such shareholders. Any
loss realized upon the redemption of shares held at the time of redemption for
six months or less from the date of their purchase will be treated as a
long-term capital loss to the extent of any amounts treated as distributions of
long-term capital gains during such six-month period.


Distributions by the fund result in a reduction in the net asset value of the
fund's shares. Should a distribution reduce the net asset value below a
shareholder's cost basis, such distribution would nevertheless be taxable to the
shareholder as ordinary income or capital gain as described above, even though,
from an investment standpoint, it may constitute a partial return of investment
capital.  For this reason, investors should consider the tax implications of
buying

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 24
<PAGE>


shares just prior to a distribution. The price of shares purchased at that time
includes the amount of the forthcoming distribution. Those purchasing just prior
to a distribution will then receive a partial return of investment capital upon
the distribution, which will nevertheless be taxable to them.


Redemptions of shares, including exchanges for shares of other American Funds,
may result in federal, state and local tax consequences (gain or loss) to the
shareholder.  However, conversion from one class to another class in the same
fund should not be a taxable event.


If a shareholder exchanges or otherwise disposes of shares of the fund within 90
days of having acquired such shares, and if, as a result of having acquired
those shares, the shareholder subsequently pays a reduced sales charge for
shares of the fund, or of a different fund, the sales charge previously incurred
in acquiring the fund's shares will not be taken into account (to the extent
such previous sales charges do not exceed the reduction in sales charges) for
the purposes of determining the amount of gain or loss on the exchange, but will
be treated as having been incurred in the acquisition of such other funds. Also,
any loss realized on a redemption or exchange of shares of the fund will be
disallowed to the extent substantially identical shares are reacquired within
the 61-day period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the shares
are disposed of.


The fund will be required to report to the IRS all distributions of investment
company taxable income and capital gains as well as gross proceeds from the
redemption or exchange of fund shares, except in the case of certain exempt
shareholders. Under the backup withholding provisions of Section 3406 of the
Code, distributions of investment company taxable income and capital gains and
proceeds from the redemption or exchange of a regulated investment company may
be subject to withholding of federal income tax in the case of non-exempt U.S.
shareholders who fail to furnish the investment company with their taxpayer
identification numbers and with required certifications regarding their status
under the federal income tax law. Withholding may also be required if the fund
is notified by the IRS or a broker that the taxpayer identification number
furnished by the shareholder is incorrect or that the shareholder has previously
failed to report interest or dividend income. If the withholding provisions are
applicable, any such distributions and proceeds, whether taken in cash or
reinvested in additional shares, will be reduced by the amounts required to be
withheld.


The foregoing discussion of U.S. federal income tax law relates solely to the
application of that law to U.S. persons, i.e., U.S. citizens and residents and
U.S. corporations, partnerships, trusts and estates. Each shareholder who is not
a U.S. person should consider the U.S. and foreign tax consequences of ownership
of shares of the fund, including the possibility that such a shareholder may be
subject to a U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an
applicable income tax treaty) on dividend income received by the shareholder.


Shareholders should consult their tax advisers about the application of federal,
state and local tax law in light of their particular situation.

The fund and the Principal Underwriter reserve the right to reject any purchase
order.  Generally, Class F shares are only available to fee-based programs of
investment firms that have special agreements with the fund's distributor and
certain registered investment advisers.  Class B and C shares are generally not
available to certain employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans,
457 plans, employer-sponsored 403(b) plans, and money purchase pension and
profit sharing plans. Class 529 shares may be purchased by investors only
through CollegeAmerica accounts. Class 529-E shares may only be purchased by
investors participating in CollegeAmerica through an eligible employer plan. In
addition, the state tax-exempt funds are only offered in certain states, and
tax-exempt funds in general should not serve as retirement plan investments.


PURCHASE MINIMUMS - The minimum initial investment for all funds in The American
Funds Group, except the money market funds and the state tax-exempt funds, is
$250.  The minimum initial investment for the money market funds (The Cash
Management Trust of America, The Tax-Exempt Money Fund of America, and The U.S.
Treasury Money Fund of America) and the state tax-exempt funds (The Tax-Exempt
Fund of California, The Tax-Exempt Fund of Maryland, and The Tax-Exempt Fund of
Virginia) is $1,000. Purchase minimums are reduced to $50 for purchases through
"Automatic Investment Plans" (except for the money market funds) or to $25 for
purchases by retirement plans through payroll deduction or by employer-sponsored
CollegeAmerica accounts and may be reduced or waived for shareholders of other
funds in The American Funds Group. The minimum is $50 for additional investments
(except for retirement plan payroll deduction and employer-sponsored
CollegeAmerica accounts as noted above).


PURCHASE MAXIMUM FOR CLASS B SHARES - The maximum purchase order for Class B
shares for all American Funds is $100,000. Direct purchases of Class B shares of
The Cash Management Trust of America are not permitted; shares may be acquired
only by exchanging from Class B shares of other American Funds. For investments
above $100,000, Class A shares are generally a less expensive option over time
due to sales charge reductions or waivers.


PURCHASE MAXIMUM FOR CLASS C SHARES - The maximum purchase order for Class C
shares for all American Funds is $500,000. Direct purchases of Class C shares of
The Cash Management Trust of America are not permitted; shares may be acquired
only by exchanging from Class C shares of other American Funds.

CLASS A PURCHASES NOT SUBJECT TO SALES CHARGES - Investments of $1 million or
more are sold with no initial sales charge.  HOWEVER, A 1% CONTINGENT DEFERRED
SALES CHARGE (CDSC) MAY BE IMPOSED IF REDEMPTIONS ARE MADE WITHIN ONE YEAR OF
PURCHASE. Employer-sponsored defined contribution-type plans investing $1
million or more, or with 100 or more eligible employees, and Individual
Retirement Account rollovers from retirement plans with assets invested in the
American Funds (see "Individual Retirement Account (IRA) Rollovers" below) may
invest with no sales charge and are not subject to a CDSC.


403(b) plans may be treated as employer-sponsored plans for sales charge
purposes if: (i) the American Funds are principal investment options; (ii) the
employer facilitates the enrollment process by, for example, allowing for onsite
group enrollment meetings held during working hours; and (iii) there is only one
dealer firm assigned to the plans.  403(b) plans meeting these criteria may
invest with no sales charge and are not subject to a CDSC if investing $1
million or more or having 100 or more eligible employees.


Investments made through accounts that purchased Class A shares of the fund
before March 15, 2001 and are part of certain qualified fee-based programs, and
retirement plans, endowments or foundations with $50 million or more in assets,
may also be made with no sales charge and are

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 30
<PAGE>


not subject to a CDSC.  A dealer concession of up to 1% may be paid by the fund
under its Class A Plan of Distribution on investments made with no initial sales
charge.


A transfer from the Virginia Prepaid Education Program or the Virginia Education
Savings Trust to a CollegeAmerica account will be made with no sales charge. No
commission will be paid to the dealer on such a transfer.


In addition, Class A shares of the stock, stock/bond and bond funds may be sold
at net asset value to:


(1)  current or retired directors, trustees, officers and advisory board members
of, and certain lawyers who provide services to, the funds managed by Capital
Research and Management Company, current or retired employees of Washington
Management Corporation, current or retired employees and partners of The Capital
Group Companies, Inc. and its affiliated companies, certain family members and
employees of the above persons, and trusts or plans primarily for such persons;

(2)  current registered representatives and assistants directly employed by such
representatives, retired registered representatives with respect to accounts
established while active, or full-time employees (and their spouses, parents,
and children) of dealers who have sales agreements with the Principal
Underwriter (or who clear transactions through such dealers) and plans for such
persons or the dealers;

(3)  current and retired registered investment advisers, with respect to
accounts established while active, registered with the Principal Underwriter, or
full-time employees (and their spouses, parents, and children) of registered
investment advisers (including assistants directly employed by individual
registered investment advisers) registered with the Principal Underwriter and
plans for such persons;

(4)  companies exchanging securities with the fund through a merger, acquisition
or exchange offer;

(5)  insurance company separate accounts;

(6)  accounts managed by subsidiaries of The Capital Group Companies, Inc.;

(7)  The Capital Group Companies, Inc., its affiliated companies and Washington
Management Corporation;

(8)  an individual or entity with a substantial business relationship with The
Capital Group Companies, Inc. or its affiliates, as determined by a Vice
President or more senior officer of the Capital Research and Management Company
Fund Administration Unit; and

(9)  wholesalers and full-time employees directly supporting wholesalers
involved in the distribution of insurance company separate accounts whose
underlying investments are managed by any affiliate of The Capital Group
Companies, Inc.

Shares are offered at net asset value to these persons and organizations due to
anticipated economies in sales effort and expense.

CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE ON CLASS A AND C SHARES -  Except as described
above, a CDSC of 1% applies to redemptions of Class A shares of the American
Funds, other than the money market funds, made within 12 months following the
purchase of Class A shares of $1 million or more made without an initial sales
charge.  A CDSC of 1% also applies to redemptions of Class C shares of the
American Funds made within 12 months following the purchase of the Class C
shares. The charge is 1% of the lesser of the value of the shares redeemed
(exclusive of reinvested dividends and capital gain distributions) or the total
cost of such shares.  Shares held the longest are assumed to be redeemed first
for purposes of calculating this CDSC. The CDSC may be waived in certain
circumstances.  See "CDSC Waivers for Class A, B and C Shares" below.


CLASS B SALES CHARGES - Class B shares are sold without any initial sales
charge.  However, a CDSC may be applied to shares you sell within six years of
purchase, as shown in the table below:

There is no CDSC on appreciation in share value above the initial purchase price
or on shares acquired through reinvestment of dividends or capital gain
distributions.  In addition, the CDSC may be waived in certain circumstances.
 See "CDSC Waivers for Class A, B and C Shares" below.  The CDSC is based on the
original purchase cost or the current market value of the shares being sold,
whichever is less.  In processing redemptions of Class B shares, shares that are
not subject to any CDSC will be redeemed first followed by shares that you have
owned the longest during the six-year period.


CLASS F AND CLASS 529-E SALES CHARGE - Class F and 529-E shares are sold with no
initial or contingent deferred sales charge.


DEALER COMMISSIONS AND COMPENSATION - For Class A shares, commissions (up to 1%)
are paid to dealers who initiate and are responsible for purchases of $1 million
or more, for purchases by any employer-sponsored defined contribution-type plan
investing $1 million or more or with 100 or more eligible employees, IRA
rollover accounts of $1 million or more (as described in "Individual Retirement
Account (IRA) Rollovers" below), and for purchases made at net asset value by
certain retirement plans, endowments and foundations with assets of $50 million
or more.  Commissions on investments in Class A shares are paid at the following
rates: 1.00% on amounts to $4 million, 0.50% on amounts over $4 million to $10
million, and 0.25% on amounts over $10 million. Commissions are based on
cumulative investments and are not annually reset.

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 32
<PAGE>


For Class B shares, compensation equal to 4.00% of the amount invested is paid
by the Principal Underwriter to dealers who sell Class B shares.


For Class C shares, compensation equal to 1.00% of the amount invested is paid
by the Principal Underwriter to dealers who sell Class C shares.


CONVERSION OF CLASS B AND C SHARES - Class B shares automatically convert to
Class A shares in the month of the eight-year anniversary of the purchase date.
 Class C shares automatically convert to Class F shares in the month of the
ten-year anniversary of the purchase date. Class 529-C shares will not convert
to Class 529-F shares. The conversion of shares is subject to the Internal
Revenue Service's continued position that the conversions are not subject to
federal income tax.  In the event the Internal Revenue Service no longer takes
this position, the automatic conversion feature may be suspended, in which event
no further conversions of Class B or C shares would occur while such suspension
remained in effect.  In that event, at your option, Class B shares could be
exchanged for Class A shares and Class C shares for Class F shares on the basis
of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of a
sales charge or fee; however, such an exchange could constitute a taxable event
for you. Absent such an exchange, Class B and C shares would continue to be
subject to higher expenses for longer than eight years and ten years,
respectively.


                      SALES CHARGE REDUCTIONS AND WAIVERS

REDUCING YOUR CLASS A SALES CHARGE - You and your "immediate family" (your
spouse and your children under age 21) may combine investments to reduce your
costs. You must let your investment dealer or American Funds Service Company
(the "Transfer Agent") know at the time you purchase shares if you qualify for a
reduction in your sales charge using one or any combination of the methods
described below.


     STATEMENT OF INTENTION - You may enter into a non-binding commitment to
     purchase shares of a fund(s) over a 13-month period and receive the same
     sales charge as if all shares had been purchased at once. This includes
     purchases made during the previous 90 days, but does not include future
     appreciation of your investment or reinvested distributions. The reduced
     sales charges and offering prices set forth in the Prospectus apply to
     purchases of $25,000 or more for equity funds and $100,000 or more for bond
     funds made within a 13-month period subject to a statement of intention
     (the "Statement"). The Statement is not a binding obligation to purchase
     the indicated amount.

     When a shareholder elects to use a Statement in order to qualify for a
     reduced sales charge, shares equal to 5% of the dollar amount specified in
     the Statement will be held in escrow in the shareholder's account out of
     the initial purchase (or subsequent purchases, if necessary) by the
     Transfer Agent. All dividends and any capital gain distributions on shares
     held in escrow will be credited to the shareholder's account in shares (or
     paid in cash, if requested). If the intended investment is not completed
     within the specified 13-month period, the purchaser will remit to the
     Principal Underwriter the difference between the sales charge actually paid
     and the sales charge which would have been paid if the total of such
     purchases had been made at a single time. The dealer assigned to the
     account at the end of the period will receive an appropriate commission
     adjustment. If the difference is not paid by the close of the Statement
     period, the appropriate number of shares held in escrow will be redeemed to
     pay such difference. If the proceeds from this

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 33
<PAGE>


     redemption are inadequate, the purchaser will be liable to the Principal
     Underwriter for the balance still outstanding.

     The Statement may be revised upward at any time during the 13-month period,
     and such a revision will be treated as a new Statement, except that the
     13-month period during which the purchase must be made will remain
     unchanged. Accordingly, upon your request, the sales charge paid on
     investments made 90 days prior to the Statement revision will be adjusted
     to reflect the revised Statement.

     Existing holdings eligible for rights of accumulation (see below),
     including Class A shares held in a fee-based arrangement, other classes of
     shares of the American Funds, and any individual investments in American
     Legacy variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies
     (American Legacy, American Legacy II and American Legacy III, American
     Legacy Life, American Legacy Variable Life, and American Legacy Estate
     Builder) may be credited toward satisfying the Statement.

     During the Statement period, reinvested dividends and capital gain
     distributions, investments in money market funds, and investments made
     under a right of reinstatement will not be credited toward satisfying the
     Statement. The Statement will be considered completed if the shareholder
     dies within the 13-month Statement period. Commissions will not be adjusted
     or paid on the difference between the Statement amount and the amount
     actually invested before the shareholder's death.

     When the trustees of certain retirement plans purchase shares by payroll
     deduction, the sales charge for the investments made during the 13-month
     period will be handled as follows: the total monthly investment will be
     multiplied by 13 and then multiplied by 1.5. The current value of existing
     American Funds investments (other than money market fund investments) and
     any rollovers or transfers reasonably anticipated to be invested in
     non-money market American Funds during the 13-month period are added to the
     figure determined above. The sum is the Statement amount and applicable
     breakpoint level. On the first investment and all other investments made
     pursuant to the Statement, a sales charge will be assessed according to the
     sales charge breakpoint thus determined. There will be no retroactive
     adjustments in sales charges on investments made during the 13-month
     period.

     Shareholders purchasing shares at a reduced sales charge under a Statement
     indicate their acceptance of these terms with their first purchase.

     AGGREGATION - Sales charge discounts are available for certain aggregated
     investments. Qualifying investments include those made by you and your
     immediate family (your spouse and your children under the age of 21), if
     all parties are purchasing shares for their own accounts and/or:

     .individual-type employee benefit plan(s), such as an IRA, 403(b) plan
      (see exception below), or single-participant Keogh-type plan;

     .business accounts solely controlled by you or your immediate family
      (for example, you own the entire business);

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 34
<PAGE>


     .trust accounts established by you or your immediate family.  However,
      if the person(s) who established the trust is deceased, the trust
      account may be aggregated with accounts of the person who is the
      primary beneficiary of the trust;

     .endowments or foundations established and controlled by you or your
      immediate family; or

     .CollegeAmerica accounts, which will be aggregated at the account owner
      level (Class 529-E accounts may only be aggregated with an eligible
      employer plan).

     Individual purchases by a trustee(s) or other fiduciary(ies) may also be
     aggregated if the investments are:

     .for a single trust estate or fiduciary account, including employee
      benefit plans other than the individual-type employee benefit plans
      described above;

     .made for two or more employee benefit plans of a single employer or of
      affiliated employers as defined in the 1940 Act, again excluding
      individual-type employee benefit plans described above;

     .for a diversified common trust fund or other diversified pooled
      account not specifically formed for the purpose of accumulating fund
      shares;

     .for non-profit, charitable or educational organizations (or any
      employer-sponsored retirement plan for such an endowment or
      foundation) or any endowments or foundations established and
      controlled by the organization; or

     .for participant accounts of a 403(b) plan that is treated as an
      employer-sponsored plan (see "Class A Purchases Not Subject to Sales
      Charges" above), or made for two or more 403(b) plans that are treated
      as employer-sponsored plans of a single employer or affiliated
      employers as defined in the 1940 Act.

     Purchases made for nominee or street name accounts (securities held in the
     name of an investment dealer or another nominee such as a bank trust
     department instead of the customer) may not be aggregated with those made
     for other accounts and may not be aggregated with other nominee or street
     name accounts unless otherwise qualified as described above.

     CONCURRENT PURCHASES - You may combine purchases of all classes of shares
     of two or more funds in The American Funds Group, as well as individual
     holdings in American Legacy variable annuity contracts and variable life
     insurance policies.  Shares of money market funds purchased through an
     exchange, reinvestment or cross-reinvestment from a fund having a sales
     charge also qualify. However, direct purchases of the money market funds
     are excluded.

     RIGHTS OF ACCUMULATION - Subject to the limitations described in the
     aggregation policy, you may take into account the current value (or if
     greater, the amount you invested less any withdrawals) of your existing
     holdings in all share classes of The American Funds Group, as well as your
     holdings in Endowments (shares of which may be owned only by tax-exempt
     organizations), to determine your sales charge on investments in accounts
     eligible to be aggregated, or when making a gift to an individual or
     charity. When determining your sales charge, you may also take into account
     the value of your individual holdings, as of the end of the week prior to
     your investment, in various American Legacy

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 35
<PAGE>



     variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies. Direct
     purchases of the money market funds are excluded.

CDSC WAIVERS FOR CLASS A, B AND C SHARES -  Any CDSC on Class A, B and C shares
(and, if applicable, on the corresponding Class 529 shares) may be waived only
in the following cases:


(1)  Permitted exchanges of shares as described in the prospectus, provided that
the shares acquired by such exchanges are not redeemed within:  (i) one year of
the initial purchase in the case of Class A or 529-A shares, (ii) six years of
the initial purchase in the case of Class B or 529-B shares, or (iii) one year
of the initial purchase in the case of Class C or 529-C shares.

(2)  Tax-free returns of excess contributions to IRAs.

(3)  Redemptions due to death or post-purchase disability of a shareholder.  In
the case of joint tenant accounts, if one joint tenant dies, a surviving joint
tenant, at the time he or she notifies the Transfer Agent of the other joint
tenant's death and removes the decedent's name from the account, may redeem
shares from the account without incurring a CDSC.  Redemptions made after the
Transfer Agent is notified of the death of a joint tenant will be subject to a
CDSC.

(4)  For Class 529-A, 529-B and 529-C shareholders only, redemptions due to a
beneficiary's death, post-purchase disability or receipt of a scholarship (to
the extent of the scholarship award).

(5)  The following types of transactions, if together they do not exceed 12% of
the value of an account annually (the "12% limit"):

     .    Required minimum distributions taken from retirement accounts upon the
          shareholder's attainment of age 70 1/2 (required minimum distributions
          that continue to be taken by the beneficiary(ies) after the account
          owner is deceased also qualify for a waiver).

     .    Redemptions through a systematic withdrawal plan ("SWP") (see
          "Automatic Withdrawals" under "Shareholder Account Services and
          Privileges", below). For each SWP payment, assets that are not subject
          to a CDSC, such as appreciation on shares and shares acquired through
          reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gain distributions, will be
          redeemed first and will count toward the 12% limit.  If there is an
          insufficient amount of assets not subject to a CDSC to cover a
          particular SWP payment, shares subject to the lowest CDSC will be
          redeemed next until the 12% limit is reached.  Any dividends and/or
          capital gain distributions taken in cash by a shareholder who receives
          payments through a SWP will also count toward the 12% limit.  In the
          case of a SWP, the 12% limit is calculated at the time a systematic
          redemption is first made, and is recalculated at the time each
          additional systematic redemption is made.  Shareholders who establish
          a SWP should be aware that the amount of a payment not subject to a
          CDSC may vary over time depending on fluctuations in the value of
          their accounts.  This privilege may be revised or terminated at any
          time.

CDSC waivers are allowed only in the cases listed above.  For example, CDSC
waivers will not be allowed on redemptions of Class 529-B and 529-C shares due
to:  termination of CollegeAmerica; a determination by the Internal Revenue
Service that CollegeAmerica does not qualify as a qualified tuition program
under the Code; proposal or enactment of law that elim-

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 36
<PAGE>



inates or limits the tax-favored status of CollegeAmerica; or the Virginia
College Savings Plan eliminating the fund as an option for additional investment
within CollegeAmerica.

                 INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) ROLLOVERS

Assets from a retirement plan (plan assets) may be invested in any class of
shares of the American Funds through an IRA rollover plan. All such rollover
investments will be subject to the terms and conditions for Class A, B, C and F
shares contained in the applicable fund's current prospectus and statement of
additional information.


An IRA rollover involving plan assets that offered an investment option managed
by any affiliate of The Capital Group Companies, Inc., including any of the
American Funds, may be invested in: (i) Class A shares at net asset value; (ii)
Class A shares subject to the applicable initial sales charge; (iii) Class B
shares; (iv) Class C shares; or (v) Class F shares.  Plan assets invested in
Class A shares with a sales charge, or B, C or F shares are subject to the terms
and conditions contained in the fund's current prospectus and statement of
additional information.  Advisers will be compensated according to the policies
associated with each share class as described in the fund's current prospectus
and statement of additional information.


Plan assets invested in Class A shares at net asset value will not be subject to
a contingent deferred sales charge and will immediately begin to accrue service
fees (i.e., shares do not have to age).  Dealer commissions will be paid only on
IRA rollovers of $1 million or more according to the schedule applicable to
Class A share investments of $1 million or more (see "Dealer Commissions and
Compensation" above).


IRA rollovers that do not indicate in which share class plan assets should be
invested and that do not have an adviser associated with the account will be
invested in Class F shares. Additional plan assets may be rolled into the
account holding F shares; however, subsequent contributions cannot be invested
in F shares.

                                PRICE OF SHARES

Shares are purchased at the offering price or sold at the net asset value price
next determined after the purchase or sell order is received and accepted by the
fund or the Transfer Agent; the offering or net asset value price is effective
for orders received prior to the time of determination of the net asset value
and, in the case of orders placed with dealers or their authorized designees,
accepted by the Principal Underwriter, the Transfer Agent, a dealer or any of
their designees. In the case of orders sent directly to the fund or the Transfer
Agent, an investment dealer MUST be indicated. The dealer is responsible for
promptly transmitting purchase and sell orders to the Principal Underwriter.


Orders received by the investment dealer or authorized designee, the Transfer
Agent, or the fund after the time of the determination of the net asset value
will be entered at the next calculated offering price. Note that investment
dealers or other intermediaries may have their own rules about share
transactions and may have earlier cut-off times than those of the fund. For more
information about how to purchase through your intermediary, contact your
intermediary directly.


Prices which appear in the newspaper do not always indicate prices at which you
will be purchasing and redeeming shares of the fund, since such prices generally
reflect the previous day's closing price whereas purchases and redemptions are
made at the next calculated price.

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 37
<PAGE>



The price you pay for shares, the offering price, is based on the net asset
value per share which is calculated once daily as of approximately 4:00 p.m. New
York time, which is the normal close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
each day the Exchange is open. If, for example, the Exchange closes at 1:00
p.m., the fund's share price would still be determined as of 4:00 p.m. New York
time. The New York Stock Exchange is currently closed on weekends and on the
following holidays: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents'
Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and
Christmas Day.


All portfolio securities of funds managed by Capital Research and Management
Company (other than money market funds) are valued, and the net asset value per
share is determined as follows:


1.    Equity securities, including depositary receipts, are valued at the last
reported sale price on the exchange or market on which such securities are
traded, as of the close of business on the day the securities are being valued
or, lacking any sales, at the last available bid price. In cases where equity
securities are traded on more than one exchange, the securities are valued on
the exchange or market determined by the Investment Adviser to be the broadest
and most representative market, which may be either a securities exchange or the
over-the-counter market. Fixed-income securities are valued at prices obtained
from a pricing service, when such prices are available; however, in
circumstances where the Investment Adviser deems it appropriate to do so, such
securities will be valued at the mean quoted bid and asked prices or at prices
for securities of comparable maturity, quality and type.

Short-term securities maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized cost which
approximates market value.


Assets or liabilities initially expressed in terms of non-U.S. currencies are
translated prior to the next determination of the net asset value of the fund's
shares into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates.


Securities and assets for which representative market quotations are not readily
available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith under procedures
adopted by authority of the fund's Board. The fair value of all other assets is
added to the value of securities to arrive at the total assets. The fund's Board
has delegated the obligation to make fair valuation determinations to a
Valuation Committee established by the fund's Investment Adviser. The Board
receives regular reports describing fair-valued securities and the valuation
methods used.


The Valuation Committee has adopted guidelines and procedures (consistent with
SEC rules and guidance) to ensure that certain basic principles and factors are
considered when making all fair value determinations. As a general principle,
securities lacking readily available market quotations are valued in good faith
by the Valuation Committee based upon what the fund might reasonably expect to
receive upon their current sale. The Valuation Committee considers all
indications of value available to it in determining the "fair value" to be
assigned to a particular security, including, without limitation, the type of
security, the existence of contractual or legal restrictions on resale, any
relevant financial or business developments affecting the issuer or its business
prospects, similar or related securities that are more actively traded, and
changes in overall market conditions. The Valuation Committee employs additional
fair value procedures to address issues related to investing substantial
portions of applicable fund portfolios outside the United States. Securities
owned by these funds trade in markets that open and close at different times,
reflecting time zone differences. If events occur after the close of a market
(and before the

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 38
<PAGE>



close of the New York Stock Exchange, when these funds' net asset values are
next determined) which affect the value of portfolio securities, appropriate
adjustments from closing market prices will be made to reflect these events.
Events of this type could include earthquakes and other natural disasters or
significant price changes in other markets (e.g., U.S. stock markets);


2.   Liabilities, including accruals of taxes and other expense items, are
deducted from total assets; and

3.   Net assets so obtained are then divided by the total number of shares
outstanding, and the result, rounded to the nearer cent, is the net asset value
per share.

Any purchase order may be rejected by the Principal Underwriter or by the fund.
The Principal Underwriter will not knowingly sell shares of the fund directly or
indirectly to any person or entity, where, after the sale, such person or entity
would own beneficially directly or indirectly more than 3.0% of the outstanding
shares of the fund without the consent of a majority of the fund's Board of
Directors.


                                 SELLING SHARES

Shares are sold at the net asset value next determined after your request is
received in good order by the Transfer Agent, dealer or any of their designees.
 Sales of certain Class A, B and C shares may be subject to a CDSC.  Generally,
Class F shares are only available to fee-based programs of investment firms that
have special agreements with the fund's distributor and certain registered
investment advisers.


You may sell (redeem) other classes of shares in your account in any of the
following ways:


     THROUGH YOUR DEALER (certain charges may apply)

     "*)   Shares held for you in your dealer's street name must be sold
           through the dealer.

     WRITING TO AMERICAN FUNDS SERVICE COMPANY

     "*)   Requests must be signed by the registered shareholder(s).

     "*)   A signature guarantee is required if the redemption is:

          -  Over $75,000;

          -  Made payable to someone other than the registered shareholder(s);
             or

          -  Sent to an address other than the address of record, or an address
             of record which has been changed within the last 10 days.

          Your signature may be guaranteed by a domestic stock exchange or the
          National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., bank, savings
          association or credit union that is an eligible guarantor institution.
          The Transfer Agent reserves the right to require a signature guarantee
          on any redemptions.

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 39
<PAGE>



     "*)  Additional documentation may be required for sales of shares held in
          corporate, partnership or fiduciary accounts.

     "*)  You must include with your written request any shares you wish to sell
          that are in certificate form.

     TELEPHONING OR FAXING AMERICAN FUNDS SERVICE COMPANY, OR USING THE INTERNET

     "*)  Redemptions by telephone, fax or the Internet (including American
          FundsLine/(R)/ and American FundsLine OnLine/(R)/) are limited to
          $75,000 per shareholder each day.

     "*)  Checks must be made payable to the registered shareholder(s).

     "*)  Checks must be mailed to an address of record that has been used with
          the account for at least 10 days.

     MONEY MARKET FUNDS

     "*)  You may have redemptions of $1,000 or more wired to your bank by
          writing American Funds Service Company.

     "*)  You may establish check writing privileges (use the money market funds
          application).

          -  If you request check writing privileges, you will be provided with
             checks that you may use to draw against your account. These checks
             may be made payable to anyone you designate and must be signed by
             the authorized number of registered shareholders exactly as
             indicated on your checking account signature card.

          -  Check writing is not available for any of the 529 share classes or
             B, C or F share classes of The Cash Management Trust of
             America.

If you sell Class A, B or C shares and request a specific dollar amount to be
sold, we will sell sufficient shares so that the sale proceeds, after deducting
any applicable CDSC, equals the dollar amount requested.


Redemption proceeds will not be mailed until sufficient time has passed to
provide reasonable assurance that checks or drafts (including certified or
cashier's checks) for shares purchased have cleared (which may take up to 15
calendar days from the purchase date). Except for delays relating to clearance
of checks for share purchases or in extraordinary circumstances (and as
permissible under the 1940 Act), sale proceeds will be paid on or before the
seventh day following receipt and acceptance of an order. Interest will not
accrue or be paid on amounts that represent uncashed distribution or redemption
checks.


If you notify the Transfer Agent, you may reinvest proceeds from a redemption,
dividend payment or capital gain distribution without a sales charge in any of
the American Funds within 90 days after the date of the redemption or
distribution. Proceeds from a Class B share redemption where a CDSC was charged
will be reinvested in Class A shares. Proceeds from any other type of

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 40
<PAGE>



redemption and all dividend payments and capital gain distributions will be
reinvested in the same share class from which the original redemption or
distribution was made. Any CDSC on Class A or C shares will be credited to your
account. Redemption proceeds of Class A shares representing direct purchases in
the money market funds that are reinvested in non-money market funds will be
subject to a sales charge. Proceeds will be reinvested at the next calculated
net asset value after your request is received and accepted by the Transfer
Agent.


                  SHAREHOLDER ACCOUNT SERVICES AND PRIVILEGES

The following services and privileges are generally available to all
shareholders.  However, certain services and privileges may not be available for
Class 529 shareholders or if your account is held with an investment dealer.


AUTOMATIC INVESTMENT PLAN - An automatic investment plan enables you to make
monthly or quarterly investments in The American Funds through automatic debits
from your bank account. To set up a plan, you must fill out an account
application and specify the amount you would like to invest ($50 minimum) and
the date on which you would like your investments to occur. The plan will begin
within 30 days after your account application is received. Your bank account
will be debited on the day or a few days before your investment is made,
depending on the bank's capabilities. The Transfer Agent will then invest your
money into the fund you specified on or around the date you specified. If the
date you specified falls on a weekend or holiday, your money will be invested on
the following business day. However, if the following business day falls in the
next month, your money will be invested on the business day immediately
preceding the weekend or holiday. If your bank account cannot be debited due to
insufficient funds, a stop-payment or the closing of the account, the plan may
be terminated and the related investment reversed. You may change the amount of
the investment or discontinue the plan at any time by writing to the Transfer
Agent.


AUTOMATIC REINVESTMENT - Dividends and capital gain distributions are reinvested
in additional shares of the same class and fund at net asset value unless you
indicate otherwise on the account application. You also may elect to have
dividends and/or capital gain distributions paid in cash by informing the fund,
the Transfer Agent or your investment dealer. Dividends and capital gain
distributions paid by the 529 share classes will be automatically reinvested.



If you have elected to receive dividends and/or capital gain distributions in
cash, and the postal or other delivery service is unable to deliver checks to
your address of record, or you do not respond to mailings from American Funds
Service Company with regard to uncashed distribution checks, your distribution
option will automatically be converted to having all dividends and other
distributions reinvested in additional shares.


CROSS-REINVESTMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS - For all share classes,
except the 529 classes of shares, you may cross-reinvest dividends and capital
gains ("distributions") of the same share class into any other fund in The
American Funds Group at net asset value, subject to the following conditions:


(a)  The aggregate value of your account(s) in the fund(s) paying distributions
equals or exceeds $5,000 (this is waived if the value of the account in the fund
receiving the distributions equals or exceeds that fund's minimum initial
investment requirement),

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 41
<PAGE>


(b)  If the value of the account of the fund receiving distributions is below
the minimum initial investment requirement, distributions must be automatically
reinvested,

(c)  If you discontinue the cross-reinvestment of distributions, the value of
the account of the fund receiving distributions must equal or exceed the minimum
initial investment requirement. If you do not meet this requirement within 90
days of notification, the fund has the right to automatically redeem the
account.

EXCHANGE PRIVILEGE - You may only exchange shares into other funds in The
American Funds Group within the same class. However, exchanges from Class A
shares of The Cash Management Trust of America may be made to Class B or C
shares of any other American Fund for dollar cost averaging purposes. Exchange
purchases are subject to the minimum investment requirements of the fund
purchased and no sales charge generally applies. However, exchanges of shares
from the money market funds are subject to applicable sales charges on the fund
being purchased, unless the money market fund shares were acquired by an
exchange from a fund having a sales charge, or by reinvestment or
cross-reinvestment of dividends or capital gain distributions. Exchanges of
Class F shares generally may only be done through fee-based programs of
investment firms that have special agreements with the fund's distributor and
certain registered investment advisers.


Exchanges from Class A, C or F shares to the corresponding 529 share class,
particularly in the case of Uniform Gifts to Minors Act or Uniform Transfer to
Minors Act custodial accounts, may result in significant legal and tax
consequences as described in the CollegeAmerica Program Description.  Please
consult your financial adviser prior to making such an exchange.


You may exchange shares of other classes by writing to the Transfer Agent (see
"Selling Shares" above), by contacting your investment dealer, by using American
FundsLine and American FundsLine OnLine (see "American FundsLine and American
FundsLine OnLine" below), or by telephoning 800/421-0180 toll-free, faxing (see
"American Funds Service Company Service Areas" in the prospectus for the
appropriate fax numbers) or telegraphing the Transfer Agent. (See "Telephone and
Internet Purchases, Redemptions and Exchanges" below.) Shares held in
corporate-type retirement plans for which Capital Bank and Trust Company serves
as trustee may not be exchanged by telephone, Internet, fax or telegraph.
Exchange redemptions and purchases are processed simultaneously at the share
prices next determined after the exchange order is received. (See "Price of
Shares" above.) THESE TRANSACTIONS HAVE THE SAME TAX CONSEQUENCES AS ORDINARY
SALES AND PURCHASES.


AUTOMATIC EXCHANGES - For all share classes, except the 529 classes of shares,
you may automatically exchange shares of the same class in amounts of $50 or
more among any of the funds in The American Funds Group on any day (or preceding
business day if the day falls on a non-business day) of each month you
designate.


AUTOMATIC WITHDRAWALS - For all share classes, except the 529 classes of shares,
you may automatically withdraw shares from any of the funds in The American
Funds Group. You can make automatic withdrawals of $50 or more as often as you
wish if your account is worth at least $10,000, or up to four times a year for
an account worth at least $5,000. You can designate the day of each period for
withdrawals and request that checks be sent to you or someone else. Withdrawals
may also be electronically deposited to your bank account. The Transfer Agent
will withdraw your money from the fund you specify on or around the date you
specify. If the date you specified falls on a weekend or holiday, the redemption
will take place on the previous business

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 42
<PAGE>


day.  However, if the previous business day falls in the preceding month, the
redemption will take place on the following business day after the weekend or
holiday.


Withdrawal payments are not to be considered as dividends, yield or income.
Automatic investments may not be made into a shareholder account from which
there are automatic withdrawals. Withdrawals of amounts exceeding reinvested
dividends and distributions and increases in share value would reduce the
aggregate value of the shareholder's account. The Transfer Agent arranges for
the redemption by the fund of sufficient shares, deposited by the shareholder
with the Transfer Agent, to provide the withdrawal payment specified.


ACCOUNT STATEMENTS - Your account is opened in accordance with your registration
instructions. Transactions in the account, such as additional investments, will
be reflected on regular confirmation statements from the Transfer Agent.
Dividend and capital gain reinvestments, purchases through automatic investment
plans and certain retirement plans, as well as automatic exchanges and
withdrawals will be confirmed at least quarterly.


AMERICAN FUNDSLINE AND AMERICAN FUNDSLINE ONLINE - You may check your share
balance, the price of your shares, or your most recent account transaction,
redeem shares (up to $75,000 per American Funds shareholder each day) from
non-retirement plan accounts, or exchange shares around the clock with American
FundsLine and American FundsLine OnLine. To use these services, call
800/325-3590 from a TouchTone(TM) telephone or access the American Funds website
on the Internet at www.americanfunds.com. Redemptions and exchanges through
American FundsLine and American FundsLine OnLine are subject to the conditions
noted above and in "Telephone and Internet Purchases, Redemptions and Exchanges"
below. You will need your fund number (see the list of funds in The American
Funds Group under "Purchase of Shares - Fund Numbers"), personal identification
number (generally the last four digits of your Social Security number or other
tax identification number associated with your account) and account number.


TELEPHONE AND INTERNET PURCHASES, REDEMPTIONS AND EXCHANGES - By using the
telephone (including American FundsLine) or the Internet (including American
FundsLine OnLine), fax or telegraph purchase, redemption and/or exchange
options, you agree to hold the fund, the Transfer Agent, any of its affiliates
or mutual funds managed by such affiliates, and each of their respective
directors, trustees, officers, employees and agents harmless from any losses,
expenses, costs or liability (including attorney fees) which may be incurred in
connection with the exercise of these privileges. Generally, all shareholders
are automatically eligible to use these options. However, you may elect to opt
out of these options by writing the Transfer Agent (you may also reinstate them
at any time by writing the Transfer Agent). If the Transfer Agent does not
employ reasonable procedures to confirm that the instructions received from any
person with appropriate account information are genuine, it and/or the fund may
be liable for losses due to unauthorized or fraudulent instructions. In the
event that shareholders are unable to reach the fund by telephone because of
technical difficulties, market conditions, or a natural disaster, redemption and
exchange requests may be made in writing only.


REDEMPTION OF SHARES - The fund's Articles of Incorporation permit the fund to
direct the Transfer Agent to redeem the shares of any shareholder for their then
current net asset value per share if at such time the shareholder of record owns
shares having an aggregate net asset value of less than the minimum initial
investment amount required of new shareholders as set forth in the fund's
current registration statement under the 1940 Act, and subject to such further
terms and conditions as the Board of Directors of the fund may from time to time
adopt.

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 43
<PAGE>



While payment of redemptions normally will be in cash, the fund's Articles of
Incorporation permit payment of the redemption price wholly or partly in
securities or other property included in the assets belonging to the fund when
in the opinion of the fund's Board of Directors, which shall be conclusive,
conditions exist which make payment wholly in cash unwise or undesirable.


SHARE CERTIFICATES - Shares are credited to your account and certificates are
not issued unless you request them by writing to the Transfer Agent.
Certificates are not available for the 529 share classes.


                      EXECUTION OF PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS

The Investment Adviser places orders for the fund's portfolio securities
transactions. The Investment Adviser strives to obtain the best available prices
in its portfolio transactions taking into account the costs and quality of
executions. When, in the opinion of the Investment Adviser, two or more brokers
(either directly or through their correspondent clearing agents) are in a
position to obtain the best price and execution, preference may be given to
brokers who have sold shares of the fund or who have provided investment
research, statistical, or other related services to the Investment Adviser. The
fund does not consider that it has an obligation to obtain the lowest available
commission rate to the exclusion of price, service and qualitative
considerations.


There are occasions on which portfolio transactions for the fund may be executed
as part of concurrent authorizations to purchase or sell the same security for
other funds served by the Investment Adviser, or for trusts or other accounts
served by affiliated companies of the Investment Adviser. Although such
concurrent authorizations potentially could be either advantageous or
disadvantageous to the fund, they are effected only when the Investment Adviser
believes that to do so is in the interest of the fund. When such concurrent
authorizations occur, the objective is to allocate the executions in an
equitable manner. The fund will not pay a mark-up for research in principal
transactions.


Brokerage commissions paid on portfolio transactions, including dealer
concessions on underwritings, if applicable, for the fiscal years ended 2002,
2001 and 2000, amounted to $22,067,000, $22,124,000 and $17,892,000,
respectively.


The fund is required to disclose information regarding investments in the
securities of its "regular" broker-dealers (or parent companies of its regular
broker-dealers) that derive more than 15% of their revenue from broker-dealer
activities. A regular broker-dealer is: (1) one of the ten broker-dealers that
received from the fund the largest amount of brokerage commissions by
participating, directly or indirectly, in the fund's portfolio transactions
during the fund's most recent fiscal year; (2) one of the ten broker-dealers
that engaged as principal in the largest dollar amount of portfolio transactions
of the fund during the fund's most recent fiscal year; or (3) one of the ten
broker-dealers that sold the largest amount of securities of the fund during the
fund's most recent fiscal year. During the fund's most recent fiscal year, the
fund's regular broker-dealer was: J.P. Morgan Chase & Company. As of the close
of its most recent fiscal year, the fund held equity securities of J.P. Morgan
Chase & Company in the amount of $183,600,000.

or non-U.S. branches of U.S. banks.


TRANSFER AGENT - American Funds Service Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Investment Adviser, maintains the records of each shareholder's account,
processes purchases and redemptions of the fund's shares, acts as dividend and
capital gain distribution disbursing agent, and performs other related
shareholder service functions. American Funds Service Company was paid a fee of
$21,649,000 for Class A shares and $963,000 for Class B shares for the 2002
fiscal year.


INDEPENDENT AUDITORS - Deloitte & Touche LLP, Two California Plaza, 350 South
Grand Avenue, Suite 200, Los Angeles, CA 90071, serves as the fund's independent
auditors providing audit services, preparation of tax returns and review of
certain documents to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
financial statements included in this Statement of Additional Information from
the Annual Report have been so included in reliance on the report of Deloitte &
Touche LLP, independent auditors, given on the authority of said firm as experts
in accounting and auditing. The selection of the fund's independent auditors is
reviewed and determined annually by the Board of Directors.


INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL - Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker LLP, 515 South
Flower Street, Los Angeles, CA 90071, currently serves as counsel for the fund
and for Directors who are not interested persons (as defined by the 1940 Act) of

fund. In an effort to reduce the volume of mail shareholders receive from the
fund when a household owns more than one account, the Transfer Agent has taken
steps to eliminate duplicate mailings of prospectuses, shareholder reports and
proxy statements. To receive additional copies of a prospectus, report or proxy
statement, shareholders should contact the Transfer Agent.

</TABLE>


            CLASS A SHARE INVESTMENT RESULTS AND RELATED STATISTICS

The fund's yield was 2.05% based on a 30-day (or one month) period ended
December 31, 2002, computed by dividing the net investment income per share
earned during the period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day
of the period, according to the following formula as required by the Securities
and Exchange Commission:


     YIELD = 2[((a-b)/cd + 1)/6/ -1]

     Where:  a   =  dividends and interest earned during the period.

             b   =  expenses accrued for the period (net of reimbursements).

             c   =  the average daily number of shares outstanding during the
                    period that were entitled to receive dividends.

             d   =  the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the
                    period.

The fund may also calculate a distribution rate on a taxable and tax equivalent
basis. The distribution rate is computed by dividing the dividends paid by the
fund over the last 12 months by the sum of the month-end net asset value or
maximum offering price and the capital gains paid over the last 12 months. The
distribution rate may differ from the yield.


The fund's one-year total return and five- and ten-year average annual total
returns at the maximum offering price for the periods ended December 31, 2002
were -22.08%, 1.33% and 10.06%, respectively.  The fund's one-year total return
and five- and ten-year average annual total returns at net asset value for the
periods ended December 31, 2002 were -17.34%, 2.54% and 10.72%, respectively.


                         Fundamental Investors - Page 46
<PAGE>


The average total return ("T") is computed by equating the value at the end of
the period ("ERV") with a hypothetical initial investment of $1,000 ("P") over a
period of years ("n") according to the following formula as required by the
Securities and Exchange Commission: P(1+T)/n/ = ERV.


In calculating average annual total return at the maximum offering price, the
fund assumes: (1) deduction of the maximum sales load of 5.75% from the $1,000
initial investment; (2) reinvestment of dividends and distributions at net asset
value on the reinvestment date determined by the Board; and (3) a complete
redemption at the end of any period illustrated. In addition, the fund will
provide lifetime average total return figures. From time to time, the fund may
calculate investment results for Class B, C, F, 529 and R shares.


The fund may also, at times, calculate total return based on net asset value per
share (rather than the offering price), in which case the figure would not
reflect the effect of any sales charges which would have been paid if shares
were purchased during the period reflected in the computation. Consequently,
total return calculated in this manner will be higher. These total returns may
be calculated over periods in addition to those described above. Total return
for the unmanaged indices will be calculated assuming reinvestment of dividends
and interest, but will not reflect any deductions for advisory fees, brokerage
costs or administrative expenses.


The fund may include information on its investment results and/or comparisons of
its investment results to various unmanaged indices (such as the Dow Jones
Average of 30 Industrial Stocks and the Standard and Poor's 500 Composite Stock
Index) or results of other mutual funds or investment or savings vehicles in
advertisements or in reports furnished to present or prospective shareholders.
The fund may also, from time to time, combine its results with those of other
funds in The American Funds Group for purposes of illustrating investment
strategies involving multiple funds.


The fund may refer to results and surveys compiled by organizations such as CDA/
Wiesenberger, Ibbotson Associates, Lipper Analytical Services, Morningstar,
Inc., and by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Additionally, the fund may refer
to results published in various newspapers and periodicals, including Barron's,
                                                                      --------
Forbes, Fortune, Institutional Investor, Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine,
------  -------  ----------------------  -------------------------------------
Money, U.S. News and World Report and The Wall Street Journal.
-----  --------------------------     -----------------------


The fund may illustrate the benefits of tax-deferral by comparing taxable
investments to investments made through tax-deferred retirement plans.


The fund may compare its investment results with the Consumer Price Index, which
is a measure of the average change in prices over time in a fixed market basket
of goods and services (e.g. food, clothing, fuels, transportation, and other
goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living).

                                    APPENDIX

                          DESCRIPTION OF BOND RATINGS

BOND RATINGS - The ratings of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") and
Standard & Poor's Corporation ("Standard & Poor's") are based on the analysis
and represents a judgment expressed in shorthand terms of the strengths and
weaknesses of the bonds which they undertake to rate. It should be emphasized,
however, that ratings are general and are not absolute standards of quality.


Moody's rates the long-term debt securities issued by various entities from
-------
"Aaa" to "C." Moody's applies the numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 in each
generic rating classification from Aa through B in its corporate bond rating
system. The modifier 1 indicates that the security ranks in the higher end of
its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and
the modifier 3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic
rating category. Ratings are described as follows:


"Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be of the best quality. They carry the
smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as 'gilt edge.'
Interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin,
and principal is secure. While the various protective elements are likely to
change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the
fundamentally strong position of such issues."


"Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards.
Together with the Aaa group, they comprise what are generally known as
high-grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of
protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities, or fluctuation of
protective elements may be of greater amplitude, or there may be other elements
present which make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than the Aaa
securities."


"Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and are to
be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors giving security to
principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present
which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future."


"Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade obligations, i.e.,
they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payments and
principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and, in
fact, have speculative characteristics as well."


"Bonds which are rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements; their future
cannot be considered as well assured. Often the protection of interest and
principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during
both good and bad times over the future. Uncertainty of position characterizes
bonds in this class."


"Bonds which are rated B generally lack characteristics of the desirable
investment. Assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of
other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small."

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 48
<PAGE>



"Bonds which are rated Caa are of poor standing. Such issues may be in default
or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or
interest."


"Bonds which are rated Ca represent obligations which are speculative in a high
degree. Such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings."


"Bonds which are rated C are the lowest rated class of bonds, and issues so
rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever attaining any
real investment standing."


Standard & Poor's rates the long-term debt securities of various entities in
-----------------
categories ranging from "AAA" to "D" according to quality. The ratings from "AA"
to "CCC" may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show
relative standing within the major rating categories. Ratings are described as
follows:


AAA
"An obligation rated 'AAA' has the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's.
The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is
extremely strong."


AA

"An obligation rated 'AA' differs from the highest rated obligations only in a
small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation is very strong."


A

"An obligation rated 'A' is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of
changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher
rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is still strong."


BBB
"An obligation rated 'BBB' exhibits adequate protection parameters. However,
adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to
a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation. Obligations rated 'BB', 'B', 'CCC', 'CC' and 'C' are regarded as
having significant speculative characteristics. 'BB' indicates the least degree
of speculation and 'C' the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions."


BB
"An obligation rated 'BB' is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to
adverse business, financial or economic conditions which could lead to the
obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation."

B
"An obligation rated 'B' is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated
'BB' but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment
on the obligation. Adverse business, financial or economic conditions will
likely impair the obligor's capacity or willingness to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation."

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 49
<PAGE>


CCC
"An obligation rated 'CCC' is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is
dependent upon favorable business, financial and economic conditions for the
obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of
adverse business, financial or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely to
have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation."

CC
"An obligation rated 'CC' is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment."

C

"A subordinated debt or preferred stock obligation rated 'C' is currently highly
vulnerable to nonpayment. The 'C' rating may be used to cover a situation where
a bankruptcy petition has been filed or similar action taken but payments on
this obligation are being continued. A 'C' also will be assigned to a preferred
stock issue in arrears on dividends or sinking fund payments but that is
currently paying."

D
"An obligation rated 'D' is in payment default. The 'D' rating category is used
when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the
applicable grace period has not expired, unless Standard & Poor's believes that
such payments will be made during such grace period. The 'D' rating also will be
used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action
if payments on an obligation are jeopardized."

1. Organization and significant accounting policies

Organization - Fundamental Investors, Inc. (the "fund") is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end, diversified management investment
company. The fund seeks long-term growth of capital and income primarily through
investments in common stocks.

The fund offers 14 share classes consisting of four retail share classes, five
CollegeAmerica savings plan share classes and five retirement plan share
classes. The CollegeAmerica savings plan share classes (529-A, 529-B, 529-C,
529-E and 529-F) are sponsored by the Commonwealth of Virginia and can be
utilized to save for college education. The five retirement plan share classes
(R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4 and R-5) are sold without any sales charges and do not carry
any conversion rights. The fund's share classes are described below:

</TABLE>


Holders of all share classes have equal pro rata rights to assets, dividends and
liquidation. Each share class has identical voting rights, except for the
exclusive right to vote on matters affecting only its class. Share classes have
different fees and expenses ("class-specific fees and expenses"), primarily due
to different arrangements for distribution, administrative and shareholder
services. Differences in class-specific fees and expenses will result in
differences in net investment income and, therefore, the payment of different
per-share dividends by each class.

Significant accounting policies - The financial statements have been prepared to
comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These principles require management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. The following is a summary of the significant accounting
policies followed by the fund:

         Security valuation - Equity securities are valued at the last reported
         sale price on the broadest and most representative exchange or market
         on which such securities are traded, as determined by the fund's
         investment adviser, as of the close of business or, lacking any sales,
         at the last available bid price. Fixed-income securities are valued at
         prices obtained from a pricing service. However, where the investment
         adviser deems it appropriate, they will be valued at the mean quoted
         bid and asked prices or at prices for securities of comparable
         maturity, quality and type. Short-term securities maturing within 60
         days are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. The
         ability of the issuers of the debt securities held by the fund to meet
         their obligations may be affected by economic developments in a
         specific industry, state or region. Securities and other assets for
         which representative market quotations are not readily available are
         valued at fair value as determined in good faith by authority of the
         fund's Board of Directors.

         Security transactions and related investment income - Security
         transactions are recorded by the fund as of the date the trades are
         executed with brokers. Realized gains and losses from security
         transactions are determined based on the specific identified cost of
         the securities. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date
         and interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. Market
         discounts, premiums and original issue discounts on fixed-income
         securities are amortized daily over the expected life of the security.

         Class allocations - Income, fees and expenses (other than
         class-specific fees and expenses) and realized and unrealized gains and
         losses are allocated daily among the various share classes based on
         their relative net assets. Class-specific fees and expenses, such as
         distribution, administrative and shareholder services, are charged
         directly to the respective share class.

         Dividends and distributions to shareholders - Dividends and
         distributions paid to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend
         date.

         Non-U.S. currency translation - Assets and liabilities, including
         investment securities, denominated in non-U.S. currencies are
         translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the end
         of the reporting period. Purchases and sales of investment securities
         and income and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at the
         exchange rates on the dates of such transactions. In the accompanying
         financial statements, the effects of changes in non-U.S. exchange rates
         on investment securities are included with the net realized gain or
         loss and net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments.
         The realized gain or loss and unrealized appreciation or depreciation
         resulting from all other transactions denominated in non-U.S.
         currencies are disclosed separately.


2. Non-U.S. investments

Investment risk - The risks of investing in securities of non-U.S. issuers may
include, but are not limited to, investment and repatriation restrictions;
revaluation of currencies; adverse political, social and economic developments;
government involvement in the private sector; limited and less reliable investor
information; lack of liquidity; certain local tax law considerations; and
limited regulation of the securities markets.

Taxation - Dividend and interest income is recorded net of non-U.S. taxes paid.


3. Federal income taxation and distributions

The fund complies with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code applicable to mutual funds and intends to distribute substantially
all of its net taxable income and net capital gains each year. The fund is not
subject to income taxes to the extent such distributions are made.

Distributions - Distributions paid to shareholders are based on net investment
income and net realized gains determined on a tax basis, which may differ from
net investment income and net realized gains for financial reporting purposes.
These differences are due primarily to differing treatment for items such as
non-U.S. currency gains and losses; short-term capital gains and losses; capital
losses related to sales of securities within 30 days of purchase; scheduled
interest payments not received; expenses deferred for tax purposes; cost of
investments sold and net capital losses. The fiscal year in which amounts are
distributed may differ from the year in which the net investment income and net
realized gains are recorded by the fund. As of December 31, 2002, the cost of
investment securities for federal income tax purposes was $18,566,244,000.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the fund reclassified $1,328,000 from
distributions in excess of net investment income to accumulated net realized
loss to align financial reporting with tax reporting.

As of December 31, 2002, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:

</TABLE>

Short-term and long-term capital loss deferrals above include capital loss
carryforwards of $95,779,000 and $577,387,000 expiring in 2009 and 2010,
respectively. The capital loss carryforwards will be used to offset any capital
gains realized by the fund in future years through the expiration dates. The
fund will not make distributions from capital gains while capital loss
carryforwards remain. Also included are capital losses of $127,678,000 that were
realized during the period November 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002.

The tax character of distributions paid to shareholders was as follows (dollars

4. Fees and transactions with related parties

Capital Research and Management Company ("CRMC"), the fund's investment adviser,
is the parent company of American Funds Service Company ("AFS"), the fund's
transfer agent, and American Funds Distributors ("AFD"), the principal
underwriter of the fund's shares.

Investment advisory services - The Investment Advisory and Service Agreement
with CRMC provides for monthly fees accrued daily. These fees are based on a
declining series of annual rates beginning with 0.390% on the first $1 billion
of daily net assets and decreasing to 0.246% on such assets in excess of $27
billion. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the investment advisory services
fee was equivalent to an annualized rate of 0.273% of average daily net assets.

Class-specific fees and expenses - Expenses that are specific to individual
share classes are accrued directly to the respective share class. The principal
class-specific fees and expenses are described below:

         Distribution services - The fund has adopted plans of distribution for
         all share classes, except Class R-5. Under the plans, the Board of
         Directors approves certain categories of expenses that are used to
         finance activities primarily intended to sell fund shares. The plans
         provide for annual expenses, based on a percentage of average daily net
         assets, ranging from 0.25% to 1.00% as noted on the next page. In some
         cases, the Board of Directors has approved expense amounts lower than
         plan limits.

</TABLE>

         All share classes may use up to 0.25% of these expenses to pay service
         fees, or to compensate AFD for paying service fees, to firms that have
         entered into agreements with AFD for providing certain shareholder
         services. Expenses in excess of these amounts, up to approved limits,
         may be used to compensate dealers and wholesalers for shares sold.

         For classes A and 529-A, the Board of Directors has also approved the
         reimbursement of dealer and wholesaler commissions paid by AFD for
         certain shares sold without a sales charge. Each class reimburses AFD
         for amounts billed within the prior 15 months but only to the extent
         that the overall annual expense limit of 0.25% is not exceeded. As of
         December 31, 2002, there were no unreimbursed expenses which remain
         subject to reimbursement for Class A or for Class 529-A.

         Transfer agent services - The fund has a transfer agent agreement with
         AFS for Class A and B shares. Under this agreement, these share classes
         compensate AFS for transfer agent services including shareholder
         recordkeeping, communications and transaction processing. AFS is also
         compensated for certain transfer agent services provided to all other
         share classes from the administrative services fees paid to CRMC
         described below.

         Administrative services - The fund has an administrative services
         agreement with CRMC to provide transfer agent and other related
         shareholder services for all classes of shares other than classes A and
         B. Each relevant class pays CRMC annual fees of 0.15% (0.10% for Class
         R-5) based on its respective average daily net assets. Each relevant
         class also pays AFS additional amounts for certain transfer agent
         services. CRMC and AFS may use these fees to compensate third parties
         for performing these services. During the start-up period for classes
         R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4, CRMC has voluntarily agreed to pay a portion of
         these fees. Each 529 share class is subject to an additional annual
         administrative fee of 0.10% of its respective average daily net assets;
         this fee is payable to the Commonwealth of Virginia for the maintenance
         of the CollegeAmerica plan. Administrative services fees are presented
         gross of any payments made by CRMC.

         Expenses under the agreements described above for the year ended
         December 31, 2002, were as follows (dollars in thousands):

     *Amount less than one thousand.

Deferred Directors' compensation - Since the adoption of the deferred
compensation plan in 1993, Directors who are unaffiliated with CRMC may elect to
defer the cash payment of part or all of their compensation. These deferred
amounts, which remain as liabilities of the fund, are treated as if invested in
shares of the fund or other American Funds. These amounts represent general,
unsecured liabilities of the fund and vary according to the total returns of the
selected funds. Directors' fees in the accompanying financial statements include
the current fees (either paid in cash or deferred) and the net increase or
decrease in the value of the deferred amounts.

Affiliated officers and Directors - Officers and certain Directors of the fund
are or may be considered to be affiliated with CRMC, AFS and AFD. No affiliated
officers or Directors received any compensation directly from the fund.

Independent Auditors' Report

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Fundamental Investors, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
Fundamental Investors, Inc. (the "Fund"), including the investment portfolio, as
of December 31, 2002, and the related statement of operations for the year then
ended, the statement of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are
the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of December 31, 2002, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers; where replies were not received from brokers, we performed other
auditing procedures. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Fundamental Investors, Inc. as of December 31, 2002, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of
the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Keogh-type plans and 403(b) plans need not be reported as taxable income.
However, many retirement plan trusts may need this information for their annual

Risk/Return Summary

The fund seeks to make your investment grow and provide you with income over
time by investing primarily in common stocks of large, established companies
that offer growth potential at reasonable prices. The fund may also invest
significantly in non-U.S. securities.

The fund is designed for investors seeking both capital appreciation and income.
 Your investment in the fund is subject to risks, including the possibility that
the fund's income and the value of its investments may fluctuate in response to
events specifically involving the companies in which the fund invests, as well
as economic, political or social events in the U.S. or abroad.

Although all securities in the fund's portfolio may be adversely affected by
currency fluctuations or global economic, political or social instability,
securities issued by entities based outside the U.S. may be affected to a
greater extent.

Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or
guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government
agency, entity or person.

YOU MAY LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN THE FUND. THE LIKELIHOOD OF LOSS IS GREATER
IF YOU INVEST FOR A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME.

HISTORICAL INVESTMENT RESULTS

The following information provides some indication of the risks of investing in
the fund by showing changes in the fund's investment results from year to year
and by showing how the fund's average annual total returns for various periods
compare with those of a broad measure of market performance. Past results are
not an indication of future results.

Unlike the bar chart on the previous page, the Investment Results Table below
reflects, as required by Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the fund's
investment results with the maximum initial sales charge imposed. Class A share
results reflect the maximum initial sales charge of 5.75%. Sales charges are
reduced for purchases of $25,000 or more. Results would be higher if calculated
without a sales charge. All fund results reflect the reinvestment of dividends
and capital gain distributions.

Because the fund's Class R shares were first available on May 15, 2002,
comparable results for these classes are not available for the 2002 calendar
year.

Unlike the Investment Results Table below, the Investment Results Table on page
7 reflects the fund's results calculated without a sales charge.

1 Lifetime results are measured from August 1, 1978, when Capital Research and
 Management Company became investment adviser for the fund's Class A shares.
2 The Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index is a market capitalization-weighted
 index based on the average weighted performance of 500 widely held common
 stocks. This index is unmanaged.
3 The Lipper Large-Cap Core Index consists of funds that invest at least 75% of
 their equity assets in companies having relatively large market
 capitalizations. These funds typically have an average price-to-earnings ratio,
 price-to-book ratio, and three-year sales-per-share growth value, compared to
 the S&P 500 Index. This index is unmanaged and includes reinvested dividends,
 capital gain distributions, and brokerage commissions paid by the funds for
 portfolio transactions, but does not reflect sales charges, expenses or taxes.
 This index was not in existence as of the date Capital Research and Management
 Company became the fund's investment adviser; therefore, lifetime results are
 not available.

 will always be 1.00% of the class' average net assets annually.

4 A portion of the fund's expenses may be used to pay third parties (including
 affiliates of the fund's investment adviser) that provide recordkeeping
 services to retirement plans invested in the fund.
5 During the start-up period for this class, Capital Research and Management
 Company voluntarily agreed to pay a portion of the fees relating to transfer
 agent services. These reimbursements are the result of higher expenses during
 the start-up period. The resulting expense ratios are not indicative of expense
 ratios expected in the future.

EXAMPLES

The examples below are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the
fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The examples assume that
you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated, that your
investment has a 5% return each year, that all dividends and capital gain
distributions are reinvested, and that the fund's operating expenses remain the
same as shown above.

Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions,
your cumulative estimated expenses would be:

Investment Objective, Strategies and Risks

The fund's investment objective is to achieve long-term growth of capital and
income. The fund invests primarily in common stocks or securities convertible
into common stocks and may invest significantly in securities of issuers
domiciled outside the U.S. and not included in the Standard & Poor's 500
Composite Index.

The prices of and the income generated by securities held by the fund may
decline in response to certain events, including: those directly involving the
companies whose securities are owned in the fund; conditions affecting the
general economy; overall market changes; local, regional or global political,
social or economic instability; and currency and interest rate fluctuations.

Investments in securities issued by entities based outside the U.S. may be
subject to the risks described above to a greater extent and may also be
affected by differing securities regulations, higher transaction costs, and
administrative difficulties such as delays in clearing and settling portfolio
transactions.

The fund may also hold cash or money market instruments. The size of the fund's
cash position will vary and will depend on various factors, including market
conditions and purchases and redemptions of fund shares. A larger cash position
could detract from the achievement of the fund's objective in a period of rising
market prices; conversely, it would reduce the fund's magnitude of loss in the
event of a general market downturn and provide liquidity to make additional
investments or to meet redemptions.

The fund relies on the professional judgment of its investment adviser, Capital
Research and Management Company, to make decisions about the fund's portfolio
investments. The basic investment philosophy of the investment adviser is to
seek attractively priced securities that represent above average long-term
investment opportunities. The investment adviser believes that the best way to
accomplish this is through fundamental analysis, including meeting with company
executives and employees, suppliers, customers and competitors. Securities may
be sold when the investment adviser believes they no longer represent good
long-term value.

OTHER IMPORTANT INVESTMENT PRACTICES

In addition to the principal investment strategies described above, the fund has
other investment practices that are described in this prospectus and in the
statement of additional information.

The fund may invest to a limited extent in lower quality debt securities rated
Ba and BB or below or unrated but determined to be of equivalent quality. The
prices of debt securities fluctuate depending on such factors as changing
interest rates, effective maturities and credit ratings. For example, their
prices generally decline when interest rates rise and vice versa. Lower quality
or longer maturity debt securities generally have higher rates of


                                     6

interest and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality or
shorter maturity debt securities.

/1/ Lifetime results are measured from August 1, 1978, when Capital Research
 and Management Company became investment adviser for the fund's Class A shares.
/2/ The Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index is a market
 capitalization-weighted index based on the average weighted performance of
 500 widely held common stocks. This index is unmanaged.
/3/ The Lipper Large-Cap Core Index consists of funds that invest at least 75%
 of their equity assets in companies having relatively large market
 capitalizations. These funds typically have an average price-to-earnings ratio,
 price-to-book ratio, and three-year sales-per-share growth value, compared to
 the S&P 500 Index. This index is unmanaged and includes reinvested dividends,
 capital gain distributions, and brokerage commissions paid by the funds for
 portfolio transactions, but does not reflect sales charges, expenses or taxes.
 This index was not in existence as of the date Capital Research and Management
 Company became the fund's investment adviser; therefore, lifetime results are
 not available.
/4/ The distribution rate is based on actual distributions paid to shareholders
 over a 12-month period. Capital gain distributions are added back to the net
 asset value to determine the rate.

from your retirement plan.

If you notify American Funds Service Company, you may reinvest proceeds from a
redemption, dividend payment or capital gain distribution without a sales charge
in any of the American Funds within 90 days after the date of the redemption or
distribution. Proceeds will be reinvested in the same share class from which the
original redemption or distribution was made. Redemption proceeds of Class A

will be reinvested at the next calculated net asset value after your request is
received and accepted by American Funds Service Company.

Exchange is open, as of approximately 4:00 p.m. New York time, the normal close
of regular trading. Assets are valued primarily on the basis of market
quotations. However, the fund has adopted procedures for making "fair value"
determinations if market quotations are not readily available.

Your shares will be purchased at the net asset value (plus any applicable sales
charge in the case of Class A shares), or sold at the net asset value next
determined after American Funds Service Company receives and accepts your
request.

CLASS A PURCHASES NOT SUBJECT TO SALES CHARGE

Employer-sponsored defined contribution-type plans, including certain 403(b)
plans, investing $1 million or more or with 100 or more eligible employees, and
Individual Retirement Account rollovers involving retirement plan assets
invested in the American Funds, may invest with no sales charge and are not
subject to a contingent deferred sales charge.  Also exempt are investments made
through accounts that purchased fund shares before March 15, 2001 and are part
of certain qualified fee-based programs. The distributor may pay dealers up to
1% on investments made in Class A shares with no initial sales charge. The fund
may reimburse the distributor for these payments through its Plans of
Distribution (see below).

Certain other investors may qualify to purchase shares without a sales charge,
such as employees of broker-dealer firms and registered investment advisers
authorized to sell American Funds, and employees of The Capital Group Companies.
Please see the statement of additional information for more information.

CLASS R SHARES

Class R shares are sold with no initial or deferred sales charges. The
distributor will pay dealers annually, asset-based compensation of 1.00% for
sales of Class R-1 shares, 0.75% for Class R-2 shares, 0.50% for Class R-3
shares, and 0.25% for Class R-4

shares. No dealer compensation is paid on sales of Class R-5 shares. The fund
may reimburse the distributor for these payments through its Plans of
Distribution (see below).

Sales Charge Reductions

TO RECEIVE A REDUCTION IN YOUR CLASS A INITIAL SALES CHARGE, YOU MUST LET YOUR
INVESTMENT DEALER OR AMERICAN FUNDS SERVICE COMPANY KNOW AT THE TIME YOU
PURCHASE SHARES THAT YOU QUALIFY FOR SUCH A REDUCTION. IF YOU DO NOT LET YOUR
DEALER OR AMERICAN FUNDS SERVICE COMPANY KNOW YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A REDUCTION,
YOU MAY NOT RECEIVE A SALES CHARGE DISCOUNT TO WHICH YOU ARE OTHERWISE ENTITLED.

REDUCING YOUR CLASS A INITIAL SALES CHARGE

Consistent with the policies described in this prospectus, two or more
retirement plans of an employer or employer's affiliates may combine all of
their American Funds investments to reduce their Class A sales charge.

CONCURRENT PURCHASES

Simultaneous purchases of any class of shares of two or more American Funds may
be combined to qualify for a reduced Class A sales charge. Direct purchases of
money market funds are excluded.

RIGHTS OF ACCUMULATION

The current value (or if greater, the amount invested less any withdrawals) of
existing holdings in any class of shares of the American Funds may be taken into
account to determine Class A sales charges. Direct purchases of money market
funds are excluded.

STATEMENT OF INTENTION

Class A sales charges may be reduced by establishing a Statement of Intention. A
Statement of Intention allows all non-money market fund purchases of all share
classes intended to be made over a 13-month period to be combined in order to
determine the applicable sales charge. At the request of a plan, purchases made
during the previous 90 days may be included; however, capital appreciation and
reinvested dividends and capital gains do not apply toward these combined
purchases. A portion of the account may be held in escrow to cover additional
Class A sales charges which may be due if total investments over the 13-month
period do not qualify for the applicable sales charge reduction.

Individual Retirement Account (IRA) Rollovers

Assets from a retirement plan may be invested in Class A, B, C or F shares of
the American Funds through an IRA rollover plan. All such rollover investments
will be subject to the terms and conditions for Class A, B, C and F shares
contained in the fund's current prospectus and statement of additional
information covering these share classes.

An IRA rollover involving retirement plan assets that offered an investment
option managed by any affiliate of The Capital Group Companies, Inc., including
any of the American Funds, may be invested in:
 . Class A shares at net asset value;
 . Class A shares subject to the applicable initial sales charge;
 . Class B shares;
 . Class C shares; or

 . Class F shares.

Retirement plan assets invested in Class A shares with a sales charge, or B, C
or F shares are subject to the terms and conditions contained in the fund's
current prospectus and statement of additional information. Advisers will be
compensated according to the policies associated with each share class as
described in the fund's current prospectus and statement of additional
information.

Retirement plan assets invested in Class A shares at net asset value will not be
subject to a contingent deferred sales charge and will immediately begin to
accrue service fees.  Dealer commissions on such assets will be paid only on
rollovers of $1 million or more.

Plans of Distribution

The fund has Plans of Distribution or "12b-1 Plans" under which it may finance
activities primarily intended to sell shares, provided the categories of
expenses are approved in advance by the fund's board of directors. The plans
provide for annual expenses of up to 0.25% for Class A shares, 1.00% for Class
R-1 shares, and up to 1.00%, 0.75% and 0.50% for Class R-2, R-3 and R-4 shares,
respectively. For all share classes, up to 0.25% of these expenses may be used
to pay service fees to qualified dealers for providing certain shareholder
services. The amount remaining for each share class may be used for distribution
expenses.

The 12b-1 fees paid by the fund, as a percentage of average net assets, for the
previous fiscal year are indicated earlier in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses
Table. Since these fees are paid out of the fund's assets or income on an
ongoing basis, over time they will increase the cost and reduce the return of an
investment.

OTHER COMPENSATION TO DEALERS

American Funds Distributors may pay, or sponsor informational meetings for,
dealers as described in the statement of additional information.

Distributions and Taxes

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

The fund intends to distribute dividends to you, usually in February, May,
August and December. Capital gains, if any, are usually distributed in December
and February. When a dividend or capital gain is distributed, the net asset
value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment.

All dividends and capital gain distributions paid to retirement plan
shareholders will automatically be reinvested.

TAXES ON DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Dividends and capital gains distributed by the fund to retirement plan accounts
currently are not taxable.

TAXES ON TRANSACTIONS

Distributions taken from a retirement plan account generally are taxable as
ordinary income.

PLEASE SEE YOUR TAX ADVISER FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

Financial Highlights/1/

The financial highlights table is intended to help you understand the fund's
results for the past five years. Certain information reflects financial results
for a single share of a particular class. The total returns in the table
represent the rate that an investor would have earned or lost on an investment
in the fund (assuming reinvestment of all dividends and capital gain
distributions). This information has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP,
whose report, along with the fund's financial statements, is included in the
statement of additional information, which is available upon request.

Risk/Return Summary

The fund seeks to make your investment grow and provide you with income over
time by investing primarily in common stocks of large, established companies
that offer growth potential at reasonable prices. The fund may also invest
significantly in non-U.S. securities.

The fund is designed for investors seeking both capital appreciation and income.
 Your investment in the fund is subject to risks, including the possibility that
the fund's income and the value of its investments may fluctuate in response to
events specifically involving the companies in which the fund invests, as well
as economic, political or social events in the U.S. or abroad.

Although all securities in the fund's portfolio may be adversely affected by
currency fluctuations or global economic, political or social instability,
securities issued by entities based outside the U.S. may be affected to a
greater extent.

Your investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or
guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government
agency, entity or person.

YOU MAY LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN THE FUND. THE LIKELIHOOD OF LOSS IS GREATER
IF YOU INVEST FOR A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME.

HISTORICAL INVESTMENT RESULTS

The following information provides some indication of the risks of investing in
the fund by showing changes in the fund's investment results from year to year
and by showing how the fund's average annual total returns for various periods
compare with those of a broad measure of market performance. Past results are
not an indication of future results.

[begin bar chart]
Calendar Year Total Results for Class A Shares
(Results do not include a sales charge; if one were included, results would
 be lower)

Unlike the bar chart on the previous page, the Investment Results Table below
reflects, as required by Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the fund's
investment results with the maximum initial sales charge imposed. Class A share
results reflect the maximum initial sales charge of 5.75%. Sales charges are
reduced for purchases of $25,000 or more. Results would be higher if calculated
without a sales charge. All fund results reflect the reinvestment of dividends
and capital gain distributions.

Because the fund's Class R shares were first available on May 15, 2002,
comparable results for these classes are not available for the 2002 calendar
year.

Unlike the Investment Results Table below, the Investment Results Table on page
7 reflects the fund's results calculated without a sales charge.

1 Lifetime results are measured from August 1, 1978, when Capital Research and
 Management Company became investment adviser for the fund's Class A shares.
2 The Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index is a market capitalization-weighted
 index based on the average weighted performance of 500 widely held common
 stocks. This index is unmanaged.
3 The Lipper Large-Cap Core Index consists of funds that invest at least 75% of
 their equity assets in companies having relatively large market
 capitalizations. These funds typically have an average price-to-earnings ratio,
 price-to-book ratio, and three-year sales-per-share growth value, compared to
 the S&P 500 Index. This index is unmanaged and includes reinvested dividends,
 capital gain distributions, and brokerage commissions paid by the funds for
 portfolio transactions, but does not reflect sales charges, expenses or taxes.
 This index was not in existence as of the date Capital Research and Management
 Company became the fund's investment adviser; therefore, lifetime results are
 not available.

EXAMPLES

The examples below are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the
fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The examples assume that
you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated, that your
investment has a 5% return each year, that all dividends and capital gain
distributions are reinvested, and that the fund's operating expenses remain the
same as shown above.

Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions,
your cumulative estimated expenses would be:

Investment Objective, Strategies and Risks

The fund's investment objective is to achieve long-term growth of capital and
income. The fund invests primarily in common stocks or securities convertible
into common stocks and may invest significantly in securities of issuers
domiciled outside the U.S. and not included in the Standard & Poor's 500
Composite Index.

The prices of and the income generated by securities held by the fund may
decline in response to certain events, including: those directly involving the
companies whose securities are owned in the fund; conditions affecting the
general economy; overall market changes; local, regional or global political,
social or economic instability; and currency and interest rate fluctuations.

Investments in securities issued by entities based outside the U.S. may be
subject to the risks described above to a greater extent and may also be
affected by differing securities regulations, higher transaction costs, and
administrative difficulties such as delays in clearing and settling portfolio
transactions.

The fund may also hold cash or money market instruments. The size of the fund's
cash position will vary and will depend on various factors, including market
conditions and purchases and redemptions of fund shares. A larger cash position
could detract from the achievement of the fund's objective in a period of rising
market prices; conversely, it would reduce the fund's magnitude of loss in the
event of a general market downturn and provide liquidity to make additional
investments or to meet redemptions.

The fund relies on the professional judgment of its investment adviser, Capital
Research and Management Company, to make decisions about the fund's portfolio
investments. The basic investment philosophy of the investment adviser is to
seek attractively priced securities that represent above average long-term
investment opportunities. The investment adviser believes that the best way to
accomplish this is through fundamental analysis, including meeting with company
executives and employees, suppliers, customers and competitors. Securities may
be sold when the investment adviser believes they no longer represent good
long-term value.

OTHER IMPORTANT INVESTMENT PRACTICES

In addition to the principal investment strategies described above, the fund has
other investment practices that are described in this prospectus and in the
statement of additional information.

The fund may invest to a limited extent in lower quality debt securities rated
Ba and BB or below or unrated but determined to be of equivalent quality. The
prices of debt securities fluctuate depending on such factors as changing
interest rates, effective maturities and credit ratings. For example, their
prices generally decline when interest rates rise and vice versa. Lower quality
or longer maturity debt securities generally have higher rates of


                                     6

interest and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality or
shorter maturity debt securities.

SALES

Please contact your plan administrator or recordkeeper in order to sell shares
from your retirement plan.

If you notify American Funds Service Company, you may reinvest proceeds from a
redemption, dividend payment or capital gain distribution without a sales charge
in any of the American Funds within 90 days after the date of the redemption or
distribution. Proceeds will be reinvested in the same share class from which the
original redemption or distribution was made. Redemption proceeds of Class A
shares representing direct purchases in the money market funds that are
reinvested in non-money market funds will be subject to a sales charge. Proceeds
will be reinvested at the next calculated net asset value after your request is
received and accepted by American Funds Service Company.

VALUING SHARES

The net asset value of each share class of the fund is the value of a single
share. The fund calculates the net asset values, each day the New York Stock
Exchange is open, as of approximately 4:00 p.m. New York time, the normal close
of regular trading. Assets are valued primarily on the basis of market
quotations. However, the fund has adopted procedures for making "fair value"
determinations if market quotations are not readily available.

Your shares will be purchased at the net asset value (plus any applicable sales
charge in the case of Class A shares), or sold at the net asset value next
determined after American Funds Service Company receives and accepts your
request.

CLASS A PURCHASES NOT SUBJECT TO SALES CHARGE

Employer-sponsored defined contribution-type plans, including certain 403(b)
plans, investing $1 million or more or with 100 or more eligible employees, and
Individual Retirement Account rollovers involving retirement plan assets
invested in the American Funds, may invest with no sales charge and are not
subject to a contingent deferred sales charge.  Also exempt are investments made
through accounts that purchased fund shares before March 15, 2001 and are part
of certain qualified fee-based programs. The distributor may pay dealers up to
1% on investments made in Class A shares with no initial sales charge. The fund
may reimburse the distributor for these payments through its Plans of
Distribution (see below).

Certain other investors may qualify to purchase shares without a sales charge,
such as employees of broker-dealer firms and registered investment advisers
authorized to sell American Funds, and employees of The Capital Group Companies.
Please see the statement of additional information for more information.

CLASS R SHARES

Class R shares are sold with no initial or deferred sales charges. The
distributor will pay dealers annually, asset-based compensation of 1.00% for
sales of Class R-1 shares, 0.75% for Class R-2 shares, 0.50% for Class R-3
shares, and 0.25% for Class R-4

shares. No dealer compensation is paid on sales of Class R-5 shares. The fund
may reimburse the distributor for these payments through its Plans of
Distribution (see below).

Sales Charge Reductions

TO RECEIVE A REDUCTION IN YOUR CLASS A INITIAL SALES CHARGE, YOU MUST LET YOUR
INVESTMENT DEALER OR AMERICAN FUNDS SERVICE COMPANY KNOW AT THE TIME YOU
PURCHASE SHARES THAT YOU QUALIFY FOR SUCH A REDUCTION. IF YOU DO NOT LET YOUR
DEALER OR AMERICAN FUNDS SERVICE COMPANY KNOW YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A REDUCTION,
YOU MAY NOT RECEIVE A SALES CHARGE DISCOUNT TO WHICH YOU ARE OTHERWISE ENTITLED.

REDUCING YOUR CLASS A INITIAL SALES CHARGE

Consistent with the policies described in this prospectus, two or more
retirement plans of an employer or employer's affiliates may combine all of
their American Funds investments to reduce their Class A sales charge.

CONCURRENT PURCHASES

Simultaneous purchases of any class of shares of two or more American Funds may
be combined to qualify for a reduced Class A sales charge. Direct purchases of
money market funds are excluded.

RIGHTS OF ACCUMULATION

The current value (or if greater, the amount invested less any withdrawals) of
existing holdings in any class of shares of the American Funds may be taken into
account to determine Class A sales charges. Direct purchases of money market
funds are excluded.

STATEMENT OF INTENTION

Class A sales charges may be reduced by establishing a Statement of Intention. A
Statement of Intention allows all non-money market fund purchases of all share
classes intended to be made over a 13-month period to be combined in order to
determine the applicable sales charge. At the request of a plan, purchases made
during the previous 90 days may be included; however, capital appreciation and
reinvested dividends and capital gains do not apply toward these combined
purchases. A portion of the account may be held in escrow to cover additional
Class A sales charges which may be due if total investments over the 13-month
period do not qualify for the applicable sales charge reduction.

Individual Retirement Account (IRA) Rollovers

Assets from a retirement plan may be invested in Class A, B, C or F shares of
the American Funds through an IRA rollover plan. All such rollover investments
will be subject to the terms and conditions for Class A, B, C and F shares
contained in the fund's current prospectus and statement of additional
information covering these share classes.

An IRA rollover involving retirement plan assets that offered an investment
option managed by any affiliate of The Capital Group Companies, Inc., including
any of the American Funds, may be invested in:
 . Class A shares at net asset value;
 . Class A shares subject to the applicable initial sales charge;
 . Class B shares;
 . Class C shares; or

 . Class F shares.

Retirement plan assets invested in Class A shares with a sales charge, or B, C
or F shares are subject to the terms and conditions contained in the fund's
current prospectus and statement of additional information. Advisers will be
compensated according to the policies associated with each share class as
described in the fund's current prospectus and statement of additional
information.

Retirement plan assets invested in Class A shares at net asset value will not be
subject to a contingent deferred sales charge and will immediately begin to
accrue service fees.  Dealer commissions on such assets will be paid only on
rollovers of $1 million or more.

Plans of Distribution

The fund has Plans of Distribution or "12b-1 Plans" under which it may finance
activities primarily intended to sell shares, provided the categories of
expenses are approved in advance by the fund's board of directors. The plans
provide for annual expenses of up to 0.25% for Class A shares, 1.00% for Class
R-1 shares, and up to 1.00%, 0.75% and 0.50% for Class R-2, R-3 and R-4 shares,
respectively. For all share classes, up to 0.25% of these expenses may be used
to pay service fees to qualified dealers for providing certain shareholder
services. The amount remaining for each share class may be used for distribution
expenses.

The 12b-1 fees paid by the fund, as a percentage of average net assets, for the
previous fiscal year are indicated earlier in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses
Table. Since these fees are paid out of the fund's assets or income on an
ongoing basis, over time they will increase the cost and reduce the return of an
investment.

OTHER COMPENSATION TO DEALERS

American Funds Distributors may pay, or sponsor informational meetings for,
dealers as described in the statement of additional information.

                 CERTAIN INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS AND GUIDELINES

The following limitations and guidelines are considered at the time of purchase,
under normal circumstances, and are based on a percentage of the fund's net
assets unless otherwise noted. This summary is not intended to reflect all of
the fund's investment limitations.


DEBT SECURITIES

.    The fund may invest up to 5% of its assets in straight debt securities
     (i.e, not convertible into equity) rated Ba or below by Moody's Investors
     Service, Inc. ("Moody's") and BB or below by Standard & Poor's Corporation
     ("S&P") or unrated but determined to be of equivalent quality.

NON-U.S. SECURITIES

.    The fund may invest up to 30% of its assets in securities of issuers that
     are domiciled outside the U.S. and not included in the S&P 500 Composite
     Index.

                      *     *     *     *     *     *

The fund may experience difficulty liquidating certain portfolio securities
during significant market declines or periods of heavy redemptions.


          DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT TECHNIQUES

The descriptions below are intended to supplement the material in the prospectus
under "Investment Objective, Strategies and Risks."


EQUITY SECURITIES - Equity securities represent an ownership position in a
company. These securities may include common stocks and securities with equity
conversion or purchase rights. The prices of equity securities fluctuate based
on changes in the financial condition of their issuers and on market and
economic conditions.


The growth-oriented, equity-type securities generally purchased by the fund may
involve large price swings and potential for loss.


DEBT SECURITIES - Debt securities are used by issuers to borrow money. Issuers
pay investors interest and generally must repay the amount borrowed at maturity.
Some debt securities, such as zero coupon bonds, do not pay current interest,
but are purchased at a discount from their face values. The prices of debt
securities fluctuate depending on such factors as interest rates, credit quality
and maturity. In general, prices of debt securities decline when interest rates
rise and increase when interest rates fall.


Lower rated debt securities, rated Ba or below by Moody's and BB or below by S&P
or unrated but determined to be of equivalent quality, are described by the
rating agencies as speculative and involve greater risk of default or price
changes due to changes in the issuer's creditworthiness than higher rated debt
securities, or they may already be in default. The market prices of these
securities may fluctuate more than higher quality securities and may decline
significantly in periods of general economic difficulty. It may be more
difficult to dispose of, or to determine the value of, lower rated debt
securities.

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 2
<PAGE>



Certain risk factors relating to debt securities are discussed below:


     SENSITIVITY TO INTEREST RATE AND ECONOMIC CHANGES - Debt securities may be
     sensitive to adverse economic changes and political and corporate
     developments and may be sensitive to interest rate changes. During an
     economic downturn or substantial period of rising interest rates, highly
     leveraged issuers may experience increased financial stress that would
     adversely affect their ability to service their principal and interest
     payment obligations, to meet projected business goals, and to obtain
     additional financing. In addition, periods of economic uncertainty and
     changes can be expected to result in increased volatility of market prices
     and yields of certain debt securities.

     PAYMENT EXPECTATIONS - Debt securities may contain redemption or call
     provisions. If an issuer exercises these provisions in a declining interest
     rate market, the fund would have to replace the security with a lower
     yielding security, resulting in a decreased return to investors. If the
     issuer of a debt security defaults on its obligations to pay interest or
     principal or enters into bankruptcy proceedings, the fund may incur losses
     or expenses in seeking recovery of amounts owed to it.

     LIQUIDITY AND VALUATION - There may be little trading in the secondary
     market for particular debt securities, which may affect adversely the
     fund's ability to value accurately or dispose of such debt securities.
     Adverse publicity and investor perceptions, whether or not based on
     fundamental analysis, may decrease the value and/or liquidity of debt
     securities.

The Investment Adviser attempts to reduce the risks described above through
diversification of the portfolio and by credit analysis of each issuer, as well
as by monitoring broad economic trends and corporate and legislative
developments, but there can be no assurance that it will be successful in doing
so.


SECURITIES WITH EQUITY AND DEBT CHARACTERISTICS - The fund may invest in
securities that have a combination of equity and debt characteristics. These
securities may at times behave more like equity than debt and vice versa. Some
types of convertible bonds or preferred stock automatically convert into common
stock. The prices and yields of non-convertible preferred stock generally move
with changes in interest rates and the issuer's credit quality, similar to the
factors affecting debt securities.


Convertible bonds, convertible preferred stock, and other securities may
sometimes be converted into common stock or other securities at a stated
conversion ratio. These securities, prior to conversion, pay a fixed rate of
interest or a dividend. Because convertible securities have both debt and equity
characteristics, their value varies in response to many factors, including the
value of the underlying assets, general market and economic conditions, and
convertible market valuations, as well as changes in interest rates, credit
spreads, and the credit quality of the issuer.


INVESTING IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES -  Investing outside the U.S. may involve special
risks, caused by, among other things: currency controls and fluctuating currency
values; different accounting, auditing, financial reporting and legal standards
and practices in some countries; changing local, regional and global economic,
political, and social conditions; expropriation or confiscatory taxation;
greater market volatility; differing securities market structures; and various
administrative difficulties such as delays in clearing and settling portfolio
transactions or in

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 3
<PAGE>



receiving payment of dividends. However, in the opinion of the Investment
Adviser, investing outside the U.S. also can reduce certain portfolio risks due
to greater diversification opportunities.


The risks described above are potentially heightened in connection with
investments in developing countries. Although there is no universally accepted
definition, a developing country is generally considered to be a country in the
initial stages of its industrialization cycle with a low per capita gross
national product. For example, political and/or economic structures in these
countries may be in their infancy and developing rapidly. Historically, the
markets of developing countries have been more volatile than the markets of
developed countries. The fund may invest in securities of issuers in developing
countries only to a limited extent.


Additional costs could be incurred in connection with the fund's investment
activities outside the U.S. Brokerage commissions may be higher outside the
U.S., and the fund will bear certain expenses in connection with its currency
transactions. Furthermore, increased custodian costs may be associated with the
maintenance of assets in certain jurisdictions.


CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS - The fund can purchase and sell currencies to facilitate
securities transactions and enter into forward currency contracts to protect
against changes in currency exchange rates. A forward currency contract is an
obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date, which may
be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the
parties, at a price set at the time of the contract. Forward currency contracts
entered into by the fund will involve the purchase or sale of one currency
against the U.S. dollar. While entering into forward currency transactions could
minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged currency,
it could also limit any potential gain which might result from an increase in
the value of the currency. The fund will not generally attempt to protect
against all potential changes in exchange rates. The fund will segregate liquid
assets which will be marked to market daily to meet its forward contract
commitments to the extent required by the Securities and Exchange Commission.


Certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may affect the extent to which
the fund may enter into forward contracts. Such transactions may also affect the
character and timing of income, gain or loss recognized by the fund for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.


INVESTING IN SMALLER CAPITALIZATION STOCKS - The fund may invest in the stocks
of smaller capitalization companies (typically companies with market
capitalizations of less than $1.5 billion at the time of purchase). The
Investment Adviser believes that the issuers of smaller capitalization stocks
often provide attractive investment opportunities. However, investing in smaller
capitalization stocks can involve greater risk than is customarily associated
with investing in stocks of larger, more established companies. For example,
smaller companies often have limited product lines, markets, or financial
resources, may be dependent for management on one or a few key persons, and can
be more susceptible to losses. Also, their securities may be thinly traded (and
therefore have to be sold at a discount from current prices or sold in small
lots over an extended period of time), may be followed by fewer investment
research analysts, and may be subject to wider price swings, thus creating a
greater chance of loss than securities of larger capitalization companies.


U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES - U.S. Treasury securities include direct obligations
of the U.S. Treasury, such as Treasury bills, notes and bonds. For these
securities, the payment of principal and interest is unconditionally guaranteed
by the U.S. government, and thus they are of the

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 4
<PAGE>



highest possible credit quality. Such securities are subject to variations in
market value due to fluctuations in interest rates, but, if held to maturity,
will be paid in full.


U.S. AGENCY SECURITIES - U.S. agency securities include those securities issued
by certain U.S. government instrumentalities and certain federal agencies. These
securities are neither direct obligations of, nor guaranteed by, the Treasury.
However, they generally involve some form of federal sponsorship: some are
backed by specific types of collateral; some are supported by the issuer's right
to borrow from the Treasury; some are supported by the discretionary authority
of the Treasury to purchase certain obligations of the issuer; and others are
supported only by the credit of the issuing government agency or
instrumentality. These agencies and instrumentalities include, but are not
limited to: Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
("Freddie Mac"), Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae"), Tennessee
Valley Authority, and Federal Farm Credit Bank System.


CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - These include: (i) commercial paper (e.g.,
short-term notes up to 9 months in maturity issued by corporations, governmental
bodies or bank/corporation sponsored conduits (asset-backed commercial paper)),
(ii) commercial bank obligations (e.g., certificates of deposit, bankers'
acceptances (time drafts on a commercial bank where the bank accepts an
irrevocable obligation to pay at maturity)), (iii) savings association and
savings bank obligations (e.g., bank notes and certificates of deposit issued by
savings banks or savings associations), (iv) securities of the U.S. government,
its agencies or instrumentalities that mature, or may be redeemed, in one year
or less, and (v) corporate bonds and notes that mature, or that may be redeemed,
in one year or less.


REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS - The fund may enter into repurchase agreements under
which the fund buys a security and obtains a simultaneous commitment from the
seller to repurchase the security at a specified time and price. Repurchase
agreements permit the fund to maintain liquidity and earn income over periods of
time as short as overnight. The seller must maintain with the fund's custodian
collateral equal to at least 100% of the repurchase price, including accrued
interest, as monitored daily by the Investment Adviser. The fund will only enter
into repurchase agreements involving securities in which it could otherwise
invest and with selected banks and securities dealers whose financial condition
is monitored by the Investment Adviser. If the seller under the repurchase
agreement defaults, the fund may incur a loss if the value of the collateral
securing the repurchase agreement has declined and may incur disposition costs
in connection with liquidating the collateral. If bankruptcy proceedings are
commenced with respect to the seller, realization of the collateral by the fund
may be delayed or limited.


RESTRICTED SECURITIES AND LIQUIDITY - The fund may purchase securities subject
to restrictions on resale. Securities not actively traded will be considered
illiquid unless they have been specifically determined to be liquid under
procedures adopted by the fund's Board of Directors, taking into account factors
such as the frequency and volume of trading, the commitment of dealers to make
markets and the availability of qualified investors, all of which can change
from time to time. The fund may incur certain additional costs in disposing of
illiquid securities.

                        *     *     *     *     *     *

PORTFOLIO TURNOVER - Portfolio changes will be made without regard to the length
of time particular investments may have been held. Short-term trading profits
are not the fund's objective, and changes in its investments are generally
accomplished gradually, though short-term transactions may occasionally be made.
High portfolio turnover (100% or more) involves

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 5
<PAGE>


correspondingly greater transaction costs in the form of dealer spreads or
brokerage commissions, and may result in the realization of net capital gains,
which are taxable when distributed to shareholders.


A fund's portfolio turnover rate would equal 100% if each security in the fund's
portfolio was replaced once per year. The fund's portfolio turnover rate for the
fiscal year ended 2002 was 38%. See "Financial Highlights" in the prospectus for
the fund's annual portfolio turnover for each of the last five fiscal periods.



                FUNDAMENTAL POLICIES AND INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS

FUNDAMENTAL POLICIES - The fund has adopted the following fundamental policies
and investment restrictions which may not be changed without approval by holders
of a majority of its outstanding shares. Such majority is defined in the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as the vote of the
lesser of (i) 67% or more of the outstanding voting securities present at a
meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities
are present in person or by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding
voting securities. All percentage limitations are considered at the time
securities are purchased and are based on the fund's net assets unless otherwise
indicated. None of the following investment restrictions involving a maximum
percentage of assets will be considered violated unless the excess occurs
immediately after, and is caused by, an acquisition by the fund.


The fund may not:


1.    borrow money or securities;

1 Amounts may be deferred by eligible Directors under a non-qualified deferred
  compensation plan adopted by the fund in 1993. Deferred amounts accumulate at
  an earnings rate determined by the total return of one or more funds in The
  American Funds Group as designated by the Directors.

2 Capital Research and Management Company manages the American Funds, consisting
  of 29 funds. Capital Research and Management Company also manages American
  Funds Insurance Series and Anchor Pathway Fund, which serve as the underlying
  investment vehicles for certain variable insurance contracts, and Endowments,
  whose shareholders are limited to certain non-profit organizations.
3 Since the deferred compensation plan's adoption, the total amount of deferred
  compensation accrued by the fund (plus earnings thereon) through the 2002
  fiscal year for participating Directors is as follows: Guilford C. Babcock
  ($167,398), Robert A. Fox ($83,025), John G. McDonald ($125,107), Gail L.
  Neale ($12,531), Henry E. Riggs ($197,764) and Patricia K. Woolf ($21,843).
  Amounts deferred and accumulated earnings thereon are not funded and are
  general unsecured liabilities of the fund until paid to the Directors.

As of February 1, 2003, the officers and Directors of the fund and their
families, as a group, owned beneficially or of record less than 1% of the
outstanding shares of the fund.


FUND ORGANIZATION AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The fund, an open-end, diversified management investment company, was organized
as a Delaware corporation on October 17, 1932 and reincorporated in Maryland on
February 1, 1990. All fund operations are supervised by the fund's Board of
Directors, which meets periodically and performs duties required by applicable
state and federal laws.


Under Maryland law, the business and affairs of the fund are managed under the
direction of the Board of Directors, and all powers of the fund are exercised by
or under the authority of the Board except as reserved to the shareholders by
law or the fund's charter or by-laws. Maryland law requires each Director to
perform his/her duties as a Director, including his/her duties as a member of
any Board committee on which he/she serves, in good faith, in a manner he/she
reasonably believes to be in the best interest of the fund, and with the care
that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar
circumstances.


Members of the Board who are not employed by Capital Research and Management
Company or its affiliates are paid certain fees for services rendered to the
fund as described above. They may elect to defer all or a portion of these fees
through a deferred compensation plan in effect for the fund.

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 13
<PAGE>



The fund has several different classes of shares, including Class A, B, C, F,
529-A, 529-B, 529-C, 529-E, 529-F, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4 and R-5 shares. Class R
shares are generally only available to employer-sponsored retirement plans. The
B, C, F and 529 share classes are described in more detail in the fund's retail
Statement of Additional Information. The shares of each class represent an
interest in the same investment portfolio. Each class has pro rata rights as to
voting, redemption, dividends and liquidation, except that each class bears
different distribution expenses and may bear different transfer agent fees and
other expenses properly attributable to the particular class as approved by the
Board of Directors and set forth in the fund's rule 18f-3 Plan. Each class'
shareholders have exclusive voting rights with respect to the respective class'
rule 12b-1 Plans adopted in connection with the distribution of shares and on
other matters in which the interests of one class are different from interests
in another class. Shares of all classes of the fund vote together on matters
that affect all classes in substantially the same manner. Each class votes as a
class on matters that affect that class alone.


The fund does not hold annual meetings of shareholders. However, significant
matters which require shareholder approval, such as certain elections of Board
members or a change in a fundamental investment policy, will be presented to
shareholders at a meeting called for such purpose. Shareholders have one vote
per share owned. At the request of the holders of at least 10% of the shares,
the fund will hold a meeting at which any member of the Board could be removed
by a majority vote.


COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The fund has an Audit Committee comprised of Guilford C. Babcock, Robert A. Fox,
Leonade D. Jones and John G. McDonald, none of whom is considered an "interested
person" of the fund within the meaning of the 1940 Act. The Committee oversees
the fund's accounting and financial reporting policies and practices, its
internal controls and the internal controls of the fund's principal service
providers. The Committee acts as a liaison between the fund's independent
auditors and the full Board of Directors. Two Audit Committee meetings were held
during the 2002 fiscal year.


The fund has a Contracts Committee comprised of Guilford C. Babcock, Robert A.
Fox, Leonade D. Jones, John G. McDonald, Gail L. Neale, Henry E. Riggs and
Patricia K. Woolf, none of whom is considered an "interested person" of the fund
within the meaning of the 1940 Act. The Committee's function is to request,
review and consider the information deemed necessary to evaluate the terms of
certain agreements between the fund and its Investment Adviser or the Investment
Adviser's affiliates, such as the Investment Advisory and Service Agreement,
Principal Underwriting Agreement, Administrative Services Agreement and Plans of
Distribution under rule 12b-1, that the fund may enter into, renew or continue,
and to make its recommendations to the full Board of Directors on these matters.
One Contracts Committee meeting was held during the 2002 fiscal year.


The fund has a Nominating Committee comprised of Guilford C. Babcock, Robert A.
Fox, Leonade D. Jones, Gail L. Neale and Patricia K. Woolf, none of whom is
considered an "interested person" of the fund within the meaning of the 1940
Act. The Committee periodically reviews such issues as the Board's composition,
responsibilities, committees, compensation and other relevant issues, and
recommends any appropriate changes to the full Board of Directors. The Committee
also evaluates, selects and nominates independent director candidates to the
full Board of Directors. While the Committee normally is able to identify from
its own resources an ample number of qualified candidates, it will consider
shareholder suggestions of persons to be

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 14
<PAGE>



considered as nominees to fill future vacancies on the Board.  Such suggestions
must be sent in writing to the Nominating Committee of the fund, c/o the fund's
Secretary, and must be accompanied by complete biographical and occupational
data on the prospective nominee, along with a written consent of the prospective
nominee for consideration of his or her name by the Committee. No Nominating
Committee meetings were held during the 2002 fiscal year.


The fund has a Proxy Committee comprised of Robert A. Fox, Leonade D. Jones,
John G. McDonald, Henry E. Riggs and Patricia K. Woolf, none of whom is
considered an "interested person" of the fund within the meaning of the 1940
Act. The Committee's functions include establishing and reviewing procedures and
policies for voting of proxies of companies held in the fund's portfolio, making
determinations with regard to certain contested proxy voting issues, and
discussing related current issues. Four Proxy Committee meetings were held
during the 2002 fiscal year.


INVESTMENT ADVISER - The Investment Adviser, Capital Research and Management
Company, founded in 1931, maintains research facilities in the U.S. and abroad
(Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington, D.C., London, Geneva, Hong
Kong, Singapore and Tokyo) with a staff of professionals, many of whom have
significant investment experience. The Investment Adviser is located at 333
South Hope Street, Los Angeles, CA 90071, and at 135 South State College
Boulevard, Brea, CA 92821. The Investment Adviser's research professionals
travel several million miles a year, making more than 5,000 research visits in
more than 50 countries around the world. The Investment Adviser believes that it
is able to attract and retain quality personnel. The Investment Adviser is a
wholly owned subsidiary of The Capital Group Companies, Inc.


The Investment Adviser is responsible for managing more than $350 billion of
stocks, bonds and money market instruments and serves over 11 million
shareholder accounts of all types throughout the world. These investors include
individuals, privately owned businesses and large corporations as well as
schools, colleges, foundations and other non-profit and tax-exempt
organizations.


INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND SERVICE AGREEMENT - The Investment Advisory and Service
Agreement (the "Agreement") between the fund and the Investment Adviser will
continue in effect until August 31, 2003, unless sooner terminated, and may be
renewed from year to year thereafter, provided that any such renewal has been
specifically approved at least annually by (i) the Board of Directors, or by the
vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting
securities of the fund, and (ii) the vote of a majority of Directors who are not
parties to the Agreement or interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of
any such party, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on
such approval. The Agreement provides that the Investment Adviser has no
liability to the fund for its acts or omissions in the performance of its
obligations to the fund not involving willful misconduct, bad faith, gross
negligence or reckless disregard of its obligations under the Agreement. The
Agreement also provides that either party has the right to terminate it, without
penalty, upon 60 days' written notice to the other party, and that the Agreement
automatically terminates in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940
Act).


In determining whether to renew the Agreement each year, the Contracts Committee
of the Board of Directors evaluates information provided by the Investment
Adviser in accordance with Section 15(c) of the 1940 Act, and presents its
recommendations to the full Board of Directors. At its most recent meeting, the
Committee reviewed and considered a number of factors in

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 15
<PAGE>



recommending renewal of the existing Agreement, including the quality of
services provided to the fund (primarily measured by investment results), fees
and expenses borne by the fund, financial results of the Investment Adviser
(including comparisons to a group of publicly held mutual fund managers) and
comparative data for other mutual funds and selected indexes.


In reviewing the quality of the services provided to the fund, the Committee
noted, among other things, that while the fund's results for 2001 were favorable
in relation to some peer groups but not others, the fund's results compared
favorably to all relevant peer groups for the five- and ten-year periods ended
March 31, 2002. The Committee also considered the overall high quality and depth
of the Investment Adviser's organization in general and of the individuals
providing portfolio research and management services to the fund. In addition,
the Committee noted the Investment Adviser's continuing financial strength and
stability.


In reviewing the fees and expenses borne by the fund, the Committee noted, among
other things, that the fund's advisory fees as a percentage of its average net
assets had declined consistently since 1992, and that such fees for 2001
compared favorably to the fund's peer group. While observing that the fund's
total expenses for 2001 (as a percentage of average net assets) also compared
favorably to the relevant peer group, the Committee noted a general growth trend
in transfer agency expenses due in large part to an increase in the number of
shareholder transactions.


Based on their review, the Committee and the Board concluded that the advisory
fees and expenses of the fund are fair, both absolutely and in comparison with
those of other funds in the industry, and that shareholders have received
reasonable value in return for paying fees and expenses.


The Investment Adviser, in addition to providing investment advisory services,
furnishes the services and pays the compensation and travel expenses of persons
to perform the executive, administrative, clerical and bookkeeping functions of
the fund, and provides suitable office space, necessary small office equipment
and utilities, general purpose accounting forms, supplies, and postage used at
the offices of the fund. The fund pays all expenses not assumed by the
Investment Adviser, including, but not limited to: custodian, stock transfer and
dividend disbursing fees and expenses; shareholder recordkeeping and
administrative expenses; costs of the designing, printing and mailing of
reports, prospectuses, proxy statements, and notices to its shareholders; taxes;
expenses of the issuance and redemption of shares of the fund (including stock
certificates, registration and qualification fees and expenses); expenses
pursuant to the fund's Plans of Distribution (described below); legal and
auditing expenses; compensation, fees and expenses paid to Directors
unaffiliated with the Investment Adviser; association dues; costs of stationery
and forms prepared exclusively for the fund; and costs of assembling and storing
shareholder account data.


As compensation for its services, the Investment Adviser receives a monthly fee
which is based on average daily net assets and is calculated at an annual rate
of 0.39% on the first $1 billion of the fund's net assets, plus 0.336% on net
assets over $1 billion to $2 billion, plus 0.30% on net assets over $2 billion
to $3 billion, plus 0.276% on net assets over $3 billion to $5 billion, plus
0.27% on net assets over $5 billion to $8 billion, plus 0.258% on net assets
over $8 billion to $13 billion, plus 0.252% on net assets over $13 billion to
$17 billion, plus 0.250% on net assets over $17 billion to $21 billion, plus
0.248% on net assets over $21 billion to $27 billion, plus 0.246% on net assets
over $27 billion.

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 16
<PAGE>


In connection with the approval of the Agreement by the fund's Board of
Directors, the Investment Adviser has agreed to waive any fees to the extent
they would exceed those payable under the rate structure contained in its
previous agreement. The fee structure referenced above is lower than that in the
previous agreement except in the event that the fund's net assets were to fall
below $8 billion when fees are equal to, or higher than, that in the previous
agreement.


The Agreement provides for a management fee reduction to the extent that the
annual ordinary operating expenses of the fund's Class A shares exceed 1% of the
average net assets in excess thereof. Expenses which are not subject to these
limitations are interest, taxes, and extraordinary expenses. Expenditures,
including costs incurred in connection with the purchase or sale of portfolio
securities, which are capitalized in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles applicable to investment companies are accounted for as
capital items and not as expenses. To the extent the fund's management fee must
be waived due to Class A share expense ratios exceeding this limit, management
fees will be reduced similarly for all classes of shares of the fund or other
Class A fees will be waived in lieu of management fees.


For the fiscal years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Investment Adviser received
from the fund advisory fees of $51,014,000, $54,760,000 and $51,298,000,
respectively.


ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES AGREEMENT - The Administrative Services Agreement (the
"Administrative Agreement") between the fund and the Investment Adviser relating
to the fund's R share classes will continue in effect until August 31, 2003,
unless sooner terminated, and may be renewed from year to year thereafter,
provided that any such renewal has been specifically approved at least annually
by the vote of a majority of Directors who are not parties to the Administrative
Agreement or interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of any such party,
cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval.
The Administrative Agreement provides that the fund may terminate the agreement
at any time by vote of a majority of Directors who are not interested persons of
the fund. The Investment Adviser has the right to terminate the Administrative
Agreement upon 60 days' written notice to the fund. The Administrative Agreement
automatically terminates in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940
Act).


Under the Administrative Agreement, the Investment Adviser provides certain
transfer agent and administrative services for shareholders of the fund's R
share classes.  The Investment Adviser contracts with third parties, including
American Funds Service Company, the fund's Transfer Agent, to provide these
services.  Services include, but are not limited to, shareholder account
maintenance, transaction processing, tax information reporting, and shareholder
and fund communications. In addition, the Investment Adviser monitors,
coordinates and oversees the activities performed by third parties providing
such services. During the start-up period for Class R-1, Class R-2, Class R-3
and Class R-4 shares, the Investment Adviser agreed to pay a portion of these
fees. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the total fees paid by the
Investment Adviser were $5,000.


As compensation for its services, the Investment Adviser receives transfer agent
fees for transfer agent services provided to the fund's applicable share
classes.  Transfer agent fees are paid monthly according to a fee schedule
contained in a Shareholder Services Agreement between the fund and American
Funds Service Company. The Investment Adviser also receives an administrative
services fee for administrative services provided to the fund's applicable share
classes.  Administrative services fees are paid monthly, accrued daily and
calculated at the annual rate of 0.15% of the average daily net assets for each
R share class except Class R-5

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 17
<PAGE>



shares. For Class R-5 shares, the administrative fee is paid monthly, accrued
daily and calculated at the annual rate of 0.10% of the average daily net assets
of Class R-5 shares.


During the fiscal period ended 2002, administrative services fees, gross of any
payments made by the Investment Adviser, were:

The fund has adopted Plans of Distribution (the "Plans") pursuant to rule 12b-1
under the 1940 Act. The Principal Underwriter receives amounts payable pursuant
to the Plans (see below). As required by rule 12b-1 and the 1940 Act, the Plans
(together with the Principal Underwriting Agreement) have been approved by the
full Board of Directors and separately by a majority of the Directors who are
not "interested persons" of the fund and who have no direct or indirect
financial interest in the operation of the Plans or the Principal Underwriting
Agreement. Potential benefits of the Plans to the fund include: shareholder
services; savings to the fund in transfer agency costs; savings to the fund in
advisory fees and other expenses; benefits to the investment

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 18
<PAGE>



process from growth or stability of assets; and maintenance of a financially
healthy management organization. The selection and nomination of Directors who
are not "interested persons" of the fund are committed to the discretion of the
Directors who are not "interested persons" during the existence of the Plans.
The Plans may not be amended to increase materially the amount spent for
distribution without shareholder approval. Plan expenses are reviewed quarterly
and the Plans must be renewed annually by the Board of Directors.


Under the Plans, the fund may annually expend the following amounts to finance
any activity primarily intended to result in the sale of fund shares, provided
the fund's Board of Directors has approved the category of expenses for which
payment is being made: (i) for Class A shares, up to 0.25% of the average daily
net assets attributable to Class A shares; (ii) for Class R-1 shares, 1.00% of
the average daily net assets attributable to Class R-1 shares; (iii) for Class
R-2 shares, up to 1.00% of the average daily net assets attributable to Class
R-2 shares; (iv) for Class R-3 shares, up to 0.75% of the average daily net
assets attributable to Class R-3 shares; and (v) for Class R-4 shares, up to
0.50% of its average daily net assets attributable to Class R-4 shares. The fund
has not adopted a Plan for Class R-5 shares; accordingly, no 12b-1 fees are paid
from Class R-5 share assets.


For Class A shares: (i) up to 0.25% is reimbursed to the Principal Underwriter
for paying service-related expenses, including service fees paid to qualified
dealers, and (ii) up to the amount allowable under the fund's Class A 12b-1
limit is reimbursed to the Principal Underwriter for paying distribution-related
expenses, including for Class A shares dealer commissions and wholesaler
compensation paid on sales of shares of $1 million or more purchased without a
sales charge (including purchases by employer-sponsored defined
contribution-type retirement plans investing $1 million or more or with 100 or
more eligible employees, and retirement plans, endowments and foundations with
$50 million or more in assets) ("no load purchases"). Commissions on no load
purchases of Class A shares, in excess of the Class A Plan limitations not
reimbursed to the Principal Underwriter during the most recent fiscal quarter
are recoverable for five quarters, provided that such commissions do not exceed
the annual expense limit. After five quarters these commissions are not
recoverable.


For Class R-1 shares: (i) 0.25% is paid to the Principal Underwriter for paying
service-related expenses, including service fees paid to qualified dealers, and
(ii) 0.75% is paid to the Principal Underwriter for distribution-related
expenses, including the financing of commissions paid to qualified dealers.


For Class R-2 shares: currently (i) 0.25% is paid to the Principal Underwriter
for paying service-related expenses, including service fees paid to qualified
dealers, and (ii) 0.50% is paid to the Principal Underwriter for paying

OTHER COMPENSATION TO DEALERS - The Principal Underwriter, at its expense (from
a designated percentage of its income), currently provides additional
compensation to dealers. Currently, these payments are limited to the top 100
dealers who have sold shares of the fund or other funds in The American Funds
Group. These payments are based principally on a pro rata share of a qualifying
dealer's sales. The Principal Underwriter will, on an annual basis, determine
the advisability of continuing these payments.

                            TAXES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

FUND TAXATION - The fund has elected to be treated as a regulated investment
company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). A
regulated investment company qualifying under Subchapter M of the Code is
required to distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its investment
company taxable income (including the excess of net short-term capital gain over
net long-term capital losses) and generally is not subject to federal income tax
to the extent that it distributes annually 100% of its investment company
taxable income and net realized capital gains in the manner required under the
Code. The fund intends to distribute annually all of its investment company
taxable income and net realized capital gains and therefore does not expect to
pay federal income tax, although in certain circumstances the fund may determine
that it is in the interest of shareholders to distribute less than that amount.



To be treated as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Code,
the fund must also (a) derive at least 90% of its gross income from dividends,
interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or
other disposition of securities or foreign currencies, or other income
(including, but not limited to, gains from options, futures or forward
contracts) derived with respect to the business of investing in such securities
or currencies, and (b) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each fiscal
quarter, (i) at least 50% of the market value of the fund's assets is
represented by cash, U.S. government securities and securities of other
regulated investment companies, and other securities (for purposes of this
calculation, generally limited in respect of any one issuer, to an amount not
greater than 5% of the market value of the fund's assets and 10% of the
outstanding voting securities of such issuer) and (ii) not more than 25% of the
value of its assets is invested in the securities of any one issuer (other than
U.S. government securities or the securities of other regulated investment
companies), or two or more issuers which the fund controls and which are
determined to be engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses.

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 20
<PAGE>


Under the Code, a nondeductible excise tax of 4% is imposed on the excess of a
regulated investment company's "required distribution" for the calendar year
ending within the regulated investment company's taxable year over the
"distributed amount" for such calendar year. The term "required distribution"
means the sum of (i) 98% of ordinary income (generally net investment income)
for the calendar year, (ii) 98% of capital gain (both long-term and short-term)
for the one-year period ending on October 31 (as though the one-year period
ending on October 31 were the regulated investment company's taxable year), and
(iii) the sum of any untaxed, undistributed net investment income and net
capital gains of the regulated investment company for prior periods. The term
"distributed amount" generally means the sum of (i) amounts actually distributed
by the fund from its current year's ordinary income and capital gain net income
and (ii) any amount on which the fund pays income tax during the periods
described above. Although the fund intends to distribute its net investment
income and net capital gains so as to avoid excise tax liability, the fund may
determine that it is the interest of shareholders to distribute a lesser amount.


The following information may not apply to you if you hold fund shares in a
non-taxable account, such as a qualified retirement plan. Please see your tax
adviser for more information.


DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAIN DISTRIBUTIONS - Dividends and capital gain
distributions on fund shares will be reinvested in shares of the fund of the
same class.  Dividends and capital gains distributed by the fund to a retirement
plan currently are not taxable.


     DIVIDENDS - The fund intends to follow the practice of distributing
     substantially all of its investment company taxable income, which includes
     any excess of net realized short-term gains over net realized long-term
     capital losses.  Investment company taxable income generally includes
     dividends, interest, net short-term capital gains in excess of net
     long-term capital losses, and certain foreign currency gains, if any, less
     expenses and certain foreign currency losses.

     Under the Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange
     rates which occur between the time the fund accrues receivables or
     liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time the fund
     actually collects such receivables, or pays such liabilities, generally are
     treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss. Similarly, on disposition of
     debt securities denominated in a foreign currency and on disposition of
     certain futures contracts, forward contracts and options, gains or losses
     attributable to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency between the
     date of acquisition of the security or contract and the date of disposition
     are also treated as ordinary gain or loss. These gains or losses, referred
     to under the Code as "Section 988" gains or losses, may increase or
     decrease the amount of the fund's investment company taxable income to be
     distributed to its shareholders as ordinary income.


     If the fund invests in stock of certain passive foreign investment
     companies, the fund may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation on a
     portion of any "excess distribution" with respect to, or gain from the
     disposition of, such stock. The tax would be determined by allocating such
     distribution or gain ratably to each day of the fund's holding period for
     the stock. The distribution or gain so allocated to any taxable year of the
     fund, other than the taxable year of the excess distribution or
     disposition, would be taxed to the fund at the highest ordinary income rate
     in effect for such year, and the tax would be further increased by an
     interest charge to reflect the value of the tax deferral deemed to have
     resulted from the ownership of the foreign company's stock. Any amount of
     distribution or

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 21
<PAGE>


     gain allocated to the taxable year of the distribution or disposition would
     be included in the fund's investment company taxable income and,
     accordingly, would not be taxable to the fund to the extent distributed by
     the fund as a dividend to its shareholders.


     To avoid such tax and interest, the fund intends to elect to treat these
     securities as sold on the last day of its fiscal year and recognize any
     gains for tax purposes at that time. Under this election, deductions for
     losses are allowable only to the extent of any prior recognized gains, and
     both gains and losses will be treated as ordinary income or loss. The fund
     will be required to distribute any resulting income, even though it has not
     sold the security and received cash to pay such distributions.  Upon
     disposition of these securities, any gain recognized is treated as ordinary
     income and loss is treated as ordinary loss to the extent of any prior
     recognized gain.


     Dividends from domestic corporations are expected to comprise some portion
     of the fund's gross income. To the extent that such dividends constitute
     any of the fund's gross income, a portion of the income distributions of
     the fund will be eligible for the deduction for dividends received by
     corporations. Shareholders will be informed of the portion of dividends
     which so qualify. The dividends-received deduction is reduced to the extent
     that either the fund shares, or the underlying shares of stock held by the
     fund, with respect to which dividends are received, are treated as
     debt-financed under federal income tax law and is eliminated if the shares
     are deemed to have been held by the shareholder or the fund, as the case
     may be, for less than 46 days during the 90-day period beginning on the
     date which is 45 days before the date on which the shares become
     ex-dividend. Capital gain distributions are not eligible for the
     dividends-received deduction.


     A portion of the difference between the issue price of zero coupon
     securities and their face value ("original issue discount") is considered
     to be income to the fund each year, even though the fund will not receive
     cash interest payments from these securities.  This original issue discount
     (imputed income) will comprise a part of the investment company taxable
     income of the fund which must be distributed to shareholders in order to
     maintain the qualification of the fund as a regulated investment company
     and to avoid federal income taxation at the level of the fund.


     In addition, some of the bonds may be purchased by the fund at a discount
     that exceeds the original issue discount on such bonds, if any.  This
     additional discount represents market discount for federal income tax
     purposes.  The gain realized on the disposition of any bond having a market
     discount may be treated as taxable ordinary income to the extent it does
     not exceed the accrued market discount on such bond or a fund may elect to
     include the market discount in income in tax years to which it is
     attributable.  Generally, accrued market discount may be figured under
     either the ratable accrual method or constant interest method.  If the fund
     has paid a premium over the face amount of a bond, the fund has the option
     of either amortizing the premium until bond maturity and reducing the
     fund's basis in the bond by the amortized amount, or not amortizing and
     treating the premium as part of the bond's basis. In the case of any debt
     security having a fixed maturity date of not more than one year from its
     date of issue, the gain realized on disposition generally will be treated
     as a short-term capital gain. In general, any gain realized on disposition
     of a security held less than one year is treated as a short-term capital
     gain.

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 22
<PAGE>


     Dividend and interest income received by the fund from sources outside the
     U.S. may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by such foreign
     jurisdictions. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may
     reduce or eliminate these foreign taxes, however. Most foreign countries do
     not impose taxes on capital gains in respect of investments by foreign
     investors.


     CAPITAL GAIN DISTRIBUTIONS - The fund also intends to follow the practice
     of distributing the entire excess of net realized long-term capital gains
     over net realized short-term capital losses. Net capital gains for a fiscal
     year are computed by taking into account any capital loss carry-forward of
     the fund.

     If any net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital
     losses are retained by the fund for reinvestment, requiring federal income
     taxes to be paid thereon by the fund, the fund intends to elect to treat
     such capital gains as having been distributed to shareholders. As a result,
     each shareholder will report such capital gains as long-term capital gains
     taxable to individual shareholders at a maximum 20% capital gains rate,
     will be able to claim a pro rata share of federal income taxes paid by the
     fund on such gains as a credit against personal federal income tax
     liability, and will be entitled to increase the adjusted tax basis on fund
     shares by the difference between a pro rata share of the retained gains and
     such shareholder's related tax credit.


SHAREHOLDER TAXATION - In January of each year, individual shareholders of the
fund will receive a statement of the federal income tax status of all
distributions. Shareholders of the fund also may be subject to state and local
taxes on distributions received from the fund. Distributions of the excess of
net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses which the fund
properly designates as "capital gain dividends" generally will be taxable to
individual shareholders at a maximum 20% capital gains rate, regardless of the
length of time the shares of the fund have been held by such shareholders. Any
loss realized upon the redemption of shares held at the time of redemption for
six months or less from the date of their purchase will be treated as a
long-term capital loss to the extent of any amounts treated as distributions of
long-term capital gains during such six-month period.


Distributions by the fund result in a reduction in the net asset value of the
fund's shares. Should a distribution reduce the net asset value below a
shareholder's cost basis, such distribution would nevertheless be taxable to the
shareholder as ordinary income or capital gain as described above, even though,
from an investment standpoint, it may constitute a partial return of investment
capital.  For this reason, investors should consider the tax implications of
buying shares just prior to a distribution. The price of shares purchased at
that time includes the amount of the forthcoming distribution. Those purchasing
just prior to a distribution will then receive a partial return of investment
capital upon the distribution, which will nevertheless be taxable to them.


Redemptions of shares, including exchanges for shares of other American Funds,
may result in federal, state and local tax consequences (gain or loss) to the
shareholder.  However, conversion from one class to another class in the same
fund should not be a taxable event.


If a shareholder exchanges or otherwise disposes of shares of the fund within 90
days of having acquired such shares, and if, as a result of having acquired
those shares, the shareholder subsequently pays a reduced sales charge for
shares of the fund, or of a different fund, the sales charge previously incurred
in acquiring the fund's shares will not be taken into account (to the

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 23
<PAGE>


extent such previous sales charges do not exceed the reduction in sales charges)
for the purposes of determining the amount of gain or loss on the exchange, but
will be treated as having been incurred in the acquisition of such other funds.
Also, any loss realized on a redemption or exchange of shares of the fund will
be disallowed to the extent substantially identical shares are reacquired within
the 61-day period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the shares
are disposed of.


The fund will be required to report to the IRS all distributions of investment
company taxable income and capital gains as well as gross proceeds from the
redemption or exchange of fund shares, except in the case of certain exempt
shareholders. Under the backup withholding provisions of Section 3406 of the
Code, distributions of investment company taxable income and capital gains and
proceeds from the redemption or exchange of a regulated investment company may
be subject to withholding of federal income tax in the case of non-exempt U.S.
shareholders who fail to furnish the investment company with their taxpayer
identification numbers and with required certifications regarding their status
under the federal income tax law. Withholding may also be required if the fund
is notified by the IRS or a broker that the taxpayer identification number
furnished by the shareholder is incorrect or that the shareholder has previously
failed to report interest or dividend income. If the withholding provisions are
applicable, any such distributions and proceeds, whether taken in cash or
reinvested in additional shares, will be reduced by the amounts required to be
withheld.


The foregoing discussion of U.S. federal income tax law relates solely to the
application of that law to U.S. persons, i.e., U.S. citizens and residents and
U.S. corporations, partnerships, trusts and estates. Each shareholder who is not
a U.S. person should consider the U.S. and foreign tax consequences of ownership
of shares of the fund, including the possibility that such a shareholder may be
subject to a U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an
applicable income tax treaty) on dividend income received by the shareholder.


Shareholders should consult their tax advisers about the application of federal,
state and local tax law in light of their particular situation.


                     PURCHASE, EXCHANGE AND SALE OF SHARES

PURCHASES - Class A shares are generally not available for retirement plans
using the PlanPremier or Recordkeeper Direct recordkeeping programs.


Class R shares are generally only available to 401(k) plans, 457 plans,
employer-sponsored 403(b) plans, profit sharing and money purchase pension
plans, defined benefit plans, and non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
Class R shares are also generally only available to retirement plans where plan
level or omnibus accounts (i.e., no participant accounts) are held on the books
of a fund. In addition, Class R-5 shares are generally only available to
retirement plans with at least $1 million or more in plan assets. Class R shares
are generally not available to retail non-retirement accounts, traditional and
Roth IRAs, Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, SEPs, SAR-SEPs, SIMPLE IRAs,
individual 403(b) plans and CollegeAmerica accounts.


Eligible retirement plans may generally open an account and purchase Class A and
R shares by contacting any investment dealer (who may impose transaction charges
in addition to those described in the fund's prospectus and statement of
additional information) authorized to sell the fund's shares. Additional shares
may be purchased through a plan's administrator or recordkeeper.

THE FUND AND THE PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT ANY PURCHASE
ORDER.

EXCHANGES - Shares of the fund generally may be exchanged into shares of the
same class of other funds in The American Funds Group. Exchange purchases are
subject to the minimum investment requirements of the fund purchased and no
sales charge generally applies.  However, exchanges of Class A shares from the
money market funds purchased without a sales charge generally will be subject to
the appropriate sales charge, unless the money market fund shares were acquired
by an exchange from a fund having a sales charge.


Shares may be exchanged into other American Funds by contacting your plan
administrator or recordkeeper.  Shares held in corporate-type retirement plans
for which Capital Bank and Trust Company serves as trustee may not be exchanged
by telephone, Internet, fax or telegraph. Exchange redemptions and purchases are
processed simultaneously at the share prices next determined after the exchange
order is received. EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS HAVE THE SAME TAX CONSEQUENCES AS
ORDINARY SALES AND PURCHASES.


SALES - Shares of the fund may be sold by contacting your plan administrator or
recordkeeper. Shares are sold at the net asset value next determined after the
request is received in good order by the Transfer Agent, dealer or any of their
designees.


Redemption proceeds will not be mailed until sufficient time has passed to
provide reasonable assurance that checks or drafts (including certified or
cashier's checks) for shares purchased have cleared (which may take up to 15
calendar days from the purchase date). Except for delays relating to clearance
of checks for share purchases or in extraordinary circumstances (and as
permissible under the 1940 Act), sale proceeds will be paid on or before the
seventh day following receipt and acceptance of an order.  Interest will not
accrue or be paid on amounts that represent uncashed distribution or redemption
checks.


If you notify the Transfer Agent, you may reinvest proceeds from a redemption,
dividend payment or capital gain distribution without a sales charge in any of
the American Funds within 90 days after the date of the redemption or
distribution. Proceeds will be reinvested in the same share class from which the
original redemption or distribution was made. Redemption proceeds of Class A
shares representing direct purchases in the money market funds that are
reinvested in non-money market funds will be subject to a sales charge. Proceeds
will be reinvested at the next calculated net asset value after the request is
received and accepted by the Transfer Agent.

CLASS A PURCHASES NOT SUBJECT TO SALES CHARGES - Investments of $1 million or
more are sold with no initial sales charge. Employer-sponsored defined
contribution-type plans investing $1 million or more, or with 100 or more
eligible employees, and Individual Retirement Account rollovers from retirement
plans with assets invested in the American Funds (see "Individual Retirement
Account (IRA) Rollovers" below) may invest with no sales charge and are not
subject to a CDSC.


403(b) plans may be treated as employer-sponsored plans for sales charge
purposes if: (i) the American Funds are principal investment options; (ii) the
employer facilitates the enrollment process by, for example, allowing for onsite
group enrollment meetings held during working hours; and (iii) there is only one
dealer firm assigned to the plans.  403(b) plans meeting these criteria may
invest with no sales charge and are not subject to a CDSC if investing $1
million or more or having 100 or more eligible employees.


Investments made through accounts that purchased Class A shares of the fund
before March 15, 2001 and are part of certain qualified fee-based programs, and
retirement plans, endowments or foundations with $50 million or more in assets,
may also be made with no sales charge and are not subject to a CDSC.  A dealer
concession of up to 1% may be paid by the fund under its Class A Plan of
Distribution on investments made with no initial sales charge.

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 27
<PAGE>



In addition, Class A shares of the stock, stock/bond and bond funds may be sold
at net asset value to:


(1)  current or retired directors, trustees, officers and advisory board members
of, and certain lawyers who provide services to, the funds managed by Capital
Research and Management Company, current or retired employees of Washington
Management Corporation, current or retired employees and partners of The Capital
Group Companies, Inc. and its affiliated companies, certain family members and
employees of the above persons, and trusts or plans primarily for such persons;

(2)  current registered representatives and assistants directly employed by such
representatives, retired registered representatives with respect to accounts
established while active, or full-time employees (and their spouses, parents,
and children) of dealers who have sales agreements with the Principal
Underwriter (or who clear transactions through such dealers) and plans for such
persons or the dealers;

(3)  current and retired registered investment advisers, with respect to
accounts established while active, registered with the Principal Underwriter, or
full-time employees (and their spouses, parents, and children) of registered
investment advisers (including assistants directly employed by individual
registered investment advisers) registered with the Principal Underwriter and
plans for such persons;

(4)  companies exchanging securities with the fund through a merger, acquisition
or exchange offer;

(5)  insurance company separate accounts;

(6)  accounts managed by subsidiaries of The Capital Group Companies, Inc.;

(7)  The Capital Group Companies, Inc., its affiliated companies and Washington
Management Corporation;

(8)  an individual or entity with a substantial business relationship with The
Capital Group Companies, Inc. or its affiliates, as determined by a Vice
President or more senior officer of the Capital Research and Management Company
Fund Administration Unit; and

(9)  wholesalers and full-time employees directly supporting wholesalers
involved in the distribution of insurance company separate accounts whose
underlying investments are managed by any affiliate of The Capital Group
Companies, Inc.

Shares are offered at net asset value to these persons and organizations due to
anticipated economies in sales effort and expense.

DEALER COMMISSIONS AND COMPENSATION - For Class A shares, commissions (up to 1%)
are paid to dealers who initiate and are responsible for purchases of $1 million
or more, for purchases by any employer-sponsored defined contribution-type plan
investing $1 million or more or with 100 or more eligible employees, IRA
rollover accounts of $1 million or more (as described in "Individual Retirement
Account (IRA) Rollovers" below), and for purchases made at net asset value by
certain retirement plans, endowments and foundations with assets of $50 million
or more.  Commissions on investments in Class A shares are paid at the following
rates:

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 28
<PAGE>


1.00% on amounts to $4 million, 0.50% on amounts over $4 million to $10 million,
and 0.25% on amounts over $10 million. Commissions are based on cumulative
investments and are not annually reset.


For Class R-1 shares, annual asset-based compensation of 1.00% is paid by the
Principal Underwriter to dealers who sell Class R-1 shares.


For Class R-2 shares, annual asset-based compensation of 0.75% is paid by the
Principal Underwriter to dealers who sell Class R-2 shares.


For Class R-3 shares, annual asset-based compensation of 0.50% is paid by the
Principal Underwriter to dealers who sell Class R-3 shares.


For Class R-4 shares, annual asset-based compensation of 0.25% is paid by the
Principal Underwriter to dealers who sell Class R-4 shares.


No dealer compensation is paid on sales of Class R-5 shares. The fund has not
adopted a plan for Class R-5 shares; accordingly no 12b-1 fee is paid from Class
R-5 assets.


                        CLASS A SALES CHARGE REDUCTIONS

REDUCING YOUR CLASS A SALES CHARGE - You must let your investment dealer or
American Funds Service Company (the "Transfer Agent") know at the time you
purchase shares if you qualify for a reduction in your sales charge using one or
any combination of the methods described below.


     STATEMENT OF INTENTION - You may enter into a non-binding commitment to
     purchase shares of a fund(s) over a 13-month period and receive the same
     sales charge as if all shares had been purchased at once. This includes
     purchases made during the previous 90 days, but does not include future
     appreciation of your investment or reinvested distributions. The reduced
     sales charges and offering prices set forth in the Prospectus apply to
     purchases of $25,000 or more for equity funds and $100,000 or more for bond
     funds made within a 13-month period subject to a statement of intention
     (the "Statement"). The Statement is not a binding obligation to purchase
     the indicated amount.

     When a shareholder elects to use a Statement in order to qualify for a
     reduced sales charge, shares equal to 5% of the dollar amount specified in
     the Statement will be held in escrow in the shareholder's account out of
     the initial purchase (or subsequent purchases, if necessary) by the
     Transfer Agent. All dividends and any capital gain distributions on shares
     held in escrow will be credited to the shareholder's account in shares (or
     paid in cash, if requested). If the intended investment is not completed
     within the specified 13-month period, the purchaser will remit to the
     Principal Underwriter the difference between the sales charge actually paid
     and the sales charge which would have been paid if the total of such
     purchases had been made at a single time. The dealer assigned to the
     account at the end of the period will receive an appropriate commission
     adjustment. If the difference is not paid by the close of the Statement
     period, the appropriate number of shares held in escrow will be redeemed to
     pay such difference. If the proceeds from this redemption are inadequate,
     the purchaser will be liable to the Principal Underwriter for the balance
     still outstanding.

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 29
<PAGE>


     The Statement may be revised upward at any time during the 13-month period,
     and such a revision will be treated as a new Statement, except that the
     13-month period during which the purchase must be made will remain
     unchanged. Accordingly, upon your request, the sales charge paid on
     investments made 90 days prior to the Statement revision will be adjusted
     to reflect the revised Statement.

     Existing holdings eligible for rights of accumulation (see below) may be
     credited toward satisfying the Statement.

     During the Statement period, reinvested dividends and capital gain
     distributions, investments in money market funds, and investments made
     under a right of reinstatement will not be credited toward satisfying the
     Statement. The Statement will be considered completed if the shareholder
     dies within the 13-month Statement period. Commissions will not be adjusted
     or paid on the difference between the Statement amount and the amount
     actually invested before the shareholder's death.

     When the trustees of certain retirement plans purchase shares by payroll
     deduction, the sales charge for the investments made during the 13-month
     period will be handled as follows: the total monthly investment will be
     multiplied by 13 and then multiplied by 1.5. The current value of existing
     American Funds investments (other than money market fund investments) and
     any rollovers or transfers reasonably anticipated to be invested in
     non-money market American Funds during the 13-month period are added to the
     figure determined above. The sum is the Statement amount and applicable
     breakpoint level. On the first investment and all other investments made
     pursuant to the Statement, a sales charge will be assessed according to the
     sales charge breakpoint thus determined. There will be no retroactive
     adjustments in sales charges on investments made during the 13-month
     period.

     Shareholders purchasing shares at a reduced sales charge under a Statement
     indicate their acceptance of these terms with their first purchase.

     AGGREGATION - Sales charge discounts are available for certain aggregated
     investments. Individual purchases by a trustee(s) or other fiduciary(ies)
     may be aggregated if the investments are:

     .for a fiduciary account, including employee benefit plans other than
      individual-type employee benefit plans, such as an IRA, 403(b) plan
      (except as described below), or single-participant Keogh-type plan;

     .made for two or more employee benefit plans of a single employer or of
      affiliated employers as defined in the 1940 Act, again excluding
      individual-type employee benefit plans described above; or

     .for participant accounts of a 403(b) plan that are treated as an
      employer-sponsored plan (see "Class A Purchases Not Subject to Sales
      Charges" above), or made for two or more 403(b) plans that are treated
      as employer-sponsored plans of a single employer or affiliated
      employers as defined in the 1940 Act.

     Purchases made for nominee or street name accounts (securities held in the
     name of an investment dealer or another nominee such as a bank trust
     department instead of the customer) may not be aggregated with those made
     for other accounts and may not be

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 30
<PAGE>


     aggregated with other nominee or street name accounts unless otherwise
     qualified as described above.

     CONCURRENT PURCHASES - You may combine purchases of all classes of shares
     of two or more funds in The American Funds Group.  Shares of money market
     funds purchased through an exchange, reinvestment or cross-reinvestment
     from a fund having a sales charge also qualify. However, direct purchases
     of the money market funds are excluded.

     RIGHTS OF ACCUMULATION - Subject to the limitations described in the
     aggregation policy, you may take into account the current value (or if
     greater, the amount you invested less any withdrawals) of your existing
     holdings in all share classes of The American Funds Group, as well as your
     holdings in Endowments (shares of which may be owned only by tax-exempt
     organizations), to determine your sales charge on investments in accounts
     eligible to be aggregated, or when making a gift to an individual or
     charity. When determining your sales charge, you may also take into account
     the value of your individual holdings, as of the end of the week prior to
     your investment, in various American Legacy variable annuity contracts and
     variable life insurance policies. Direct purchases of the money market
     funds are excluded.

                 INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA) ROLLOVERS

Assets from a retirement plan (plan assets) may be invested in any class of
shares of the American Funds through an IRA rollover plan. All such rollover
investments will be subject to the terms and conditions for Class A, B, C and F
shares contained in the applicable fund's current prospectus and statement of
additional information.


An IRA rollover involving plan assets that offered an investment option managed
by any affiliate of The Capital Group Companies, Inc., including any of the
American Funds, may be invested in: (i) Class A shares at net asset value; (ii)
Class A shares subject to the applicable initial sales charge; (iii) Class B
shares; (iv) Class C shares; or (v) Class F shares.  Plan assets invested in
Class A shares with a sales charge, or B, C or F shares are subject to the terms
and conditions contained in the fund's current prospectus and statement of
additional information.  Advisers will be compensated according to the policies
associated with each share class as described in the fund's current prospectus
and statement of additional information.


Plan assets invested in Class A shares at net asset value will not be subject to
a contingent deferred sales charge and will immediately begin to accrue service
fees (i.e., shares do not have to age).  Dealer commissions will be paid only on
IRA rollovers of $1 million or more according to the schedule applicable to
Class A share investments of $1 million or more (see "Dealer Commissions and
Compensation" above).


IRA rollovers that do not indicate in which share class plan assets should be
invested and that do not have an adviser associated with the account will be
invested in Class F shares. Additional plan assets may be rolled into the
account holding F shares; however, subsequent contributions cannot be invested
in F shares.

                                PRICE OF SHARES

Shares are purchased at the offering price or sold at the net asset value price
next determined after the purchase or sell order is received and accepted by the
fund or the Transfer Agent; the

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 31
<PAGE>


offering or net asset value price is effective for orders received prior to the
time of determination of the net asset value and, in the case of orders placed
with dealers or their authorized designees, accepted by the Principal
Underwriter, the Transfer Agent, a dealer or any of their designees. In the case
of orders sent directly to the fund or the Transfer Agent, an investment dealer
MUST be indicated. The dealer is responsible for promptly transmitting purchase
and sell orders to the Principal Underwriter.


Orders received by the investment dealer or authorized designee, the Transfer
Agent, or the fund after the time of the determination of the net asset value
will be entered at the next calculated offering price. Note that investment
dealers or other intermediaries may have their own rules about share
transactions and may have earlier cut-off times than those of the fund. For more
information about how to purchase through your intermediary, contact your
intermediary directly.


Prices which appear in the newspaper do not always indicate prices at which you
will be purchasing and redeeming shares of the fund, since such prices generally
reflect the previous day's closing price whereas purchases and redemptions are
made at the next calculated price. The price you pay for shares, the offering
price, is based on the net asset value per share which is calculated once daily
as of approximately 4:00 p.m. New York time, which is the normal close of
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, each day the Exchange is open. If, for
example, the Exchange closes at 1:00 p.m., the fund's share price would still be
determined as of 4:00 p.m. New York time. The New York Stock Exchange is
currently closed on weekends and on the following holidays: New Year's Day,
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas Day.


All portfolio securities of funds managed by Capital Research and Management
Company (other than money market funds) are valued, and the net asset value per
share is determined as follows:


1.    Equity securities, including depositary receipts, are valued at the last
reported sale price on the exchange or market on which such securities are
traded, as of the close of business on the day the securities are being valued
or, lacking any sales, at the last available bid price. In cases where equity
securities are traded on more than one exchange, the securities are valued on
the exchange or market determined by the Investment Adviser to be the broadest
and most representative market, which may be either a securities exchange or the
over-the-counter market. Fixed-income securities are valued at prices obtained
from a pricing service, when such prices are available; however, in
circumstances where the Investment Adviser deems it appropriate to do so, such
securities will be valued at the mean quoted bid and asked prices or at prices
for securities of comparable maturity, quality and type.

Short-term securities maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized cost which
approximates market value.


Assets or liabilities initially expressed in terms of non-U.S. currencies are
translated prior to the next determination of the net asset value of the fund's
shares into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates.


Securities and assets for which representative market quotations are not readily
available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith under procedures
adopted by authority of the fund's Board. The fair value of all other assets is
added to the value of securities to arrive at the total assets. The fund's Board
has delegated the obligation to make fair valuation determinations

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 32
<PAGE>



to a Valuation Committee established by the fund's Investment Adviser. The Board
receives regular reports describing fair-valued securities and the valuation
methods used.


The Valuation Committee has adopted guidelines and procedures (consistent with
SEC rules and guidance) to ensure that certain basic principles and factors are
considered when making all fair value determinations. As a general principle,
securities lacking readily available market quotations are valued in good faith
by the Valuation Committee based upon what the fund might reasonably expect to
receive upon their current sale. The Valuation Committee considers all
indications of value available to it in determining the "fair value" to be
assigned to a particular security, including, without limitation, the type of
security, the existence of contractual or legal restrictions on resale, any
relevant financial or business developments affecting the issuer or its business
prospects, similar or related securities that are more actively traded, and
changes in overall market conditions. The Valuation Committee employs additional
fair value procedures to address issues related to investing substantial
portions of applicable fund portfolios outside the United States. Securities
owned by these funds trade in markets that open and close at different times,
reflecting time zone differences. If events occur after the close of a market
(and before the close of the New York Stock Exchange, when these funds' net
asset values are next determined) which affect the value of portfolio
securities, appropriate adjustments from closing market prices will be made to
reflect these events. Events of this type could include earthquakes and other
natural disasters or significant price changes in other markets (e.g., U.S.
stock markets);


2.   Liabilities, including accruals of taxes and other expense items, are
deducted from total assets; and

3.   Net assets so obtained are then divided by the total number of shares
outstanding, and the result, rounded to the nearer cent, is the net asset value
per share.

Any purchase order may be rejected by the Principal Underwriter or by the fund.
The Principal Underwriter will not knowingly sell shares of the fund directly or
indirectly to any person or entity, where, after the sale, such person or entity
would own beneficially directly or indirectly more than 3.0% of the outstanding
shares of the fund without the consent of a majority of the fund's Board of
Directors.


                  SHAREHOLDER ACCOUNT SERVICES AND PRIVILEGES

ACCOUNT STATEMENTS - Your account is opened in accordance with your registration
instructions. Transactions in the account, such as additional investments, will
be reflected on regular confirmation statements from the Transfer Agent.
Dividend and capital gain reinvestments, and purchases through certain
retirement plans, will be confirmed at least quarterly.


REDEMPTION OF SHARES - The fund's Articles of Incorporation permit the fund to
direct the Transfer Agent to redeem the shares of any shareholder for their then
current net asset value per share if at such time the shareholder of record owns
shares having an aggregate net asset value of less than the minimum initial
investment amount required of new shareholders as set forth in the fund's
current registration statement under the 1940 Act, and subject to such further
terms and conditions as the Board of Directors of the fund may from time to time
adopt.


While payment of redemptions normally will be in cash, the fund's Articles of
Incorporation permit payment of the redemption price wholly or partly in
securities or other property included in the

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 33
<PAGE>



assets belonging to the fund when in the opinion of the fund's Board of
Directors, which shall be conclusive, conditions exist which make payment wholly
in cash unwise or undesirable.


SHARE CERTIFICATES - Shares are credited to your account and certificates are
not issued unless you request them by writing to the Transfer Agent.
Certificates are not available for the R share classes.


                      EXECUTION OF PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS

The Investment Adviser places orders for the fund's portfolio securities
transactions. The Investment Adviser strives to obtain the best available prices
in its portfolio transactions taking into account the costs and quality of
executions. When, in the opinion of the Investment Adviser, two or more brokers
(either directly or through their correspondent clearing agents) are in a
position to obtain the best price and execution, preference may be given to
brokers who have sold shares of the fund or who have provided investment
research, statistical, or other related services to the Investment Adviser. The
fund does not consider that it has an obligation to obtain the lowest available
commission rate to the exclusion of price, service and qualitative
considerations.


There are occasions on which portfolio transactions for the fund may be executed
as part of concurrent authorizations to purchase or sell the same security for
other funds served by the Investment Adviser, or for trusts or other accounts
served by affiliated companies of the Investment Adviser. Although such
concurrent authorizations potentially could be either advantageous or
disadvantageous to the fund, they are effected only when the Investment Adviser
believes that to do so is in the interest of the fund. When such concurrent
authorizations occur, the objective is to allocate the executions in an
equitable manner. The fund will not pay a mark-up for research in principal
transactions.


Brokerage commissions paid on portfolio transactions, including dealer
concessions on underwritings, if applicable, for the fiscal years ended 2002,
2001 and 2000, amounted to $22,067,000, $22,124,000 and $17,892,000,
respectively.


The fund is required to disclose information regarding investments in the
securities of its "regular" broker-dealers (or parent companies of its regular
broker-dealers) that derive more than 15% of their revenue from broker-dealer
activities. A regular broker-dealer is: (1) one of the ten broker-dealers that
received from the fund the largest amount of brokerage commissions by
participating, directly or indirectly, in the fund's portfolio transactions
during the fund's most recent fiscal year; (2) one of the ten broker-dealers
that engaged as principal in the largest dollar amount of portfolio transactions
of the fund during the fund's most recent fiscal year; or (3) one of the ten

TRANSFER AGENT - American Funds Service Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Investment Adviser, maintains the records of each shareholder's account,
processes purchases and redemptions of the fund's shares, acts as dividend and
capital gain distribution disbursing agent, and performs other related
shareholder service functions. American Funds Service Company was paid a fee of
$21,649,000 for Class A shares for the 2002 fiscal year.


INDEPENDENT AUDITORS - Deloitte & Touche LLP, Two California Plaza, 350 South
Grand Avenue, Suite 200, Los Angeles, CA 90071, serves as the fund's independent
auditors providing audit services, preparation of tax returns and review of
certain documents to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
financial statements included in this Statement of Additional Information from
the Annual Report have been so included in reliance on the report of Deloitte &
Touche LLP, independent auditors, given on the authority of said firm as experts
in accounting and auditing. The selection of the fund's independent auditors is
reviewed and determined annually by the Board of Directors.

</TABLE>


            CLASS A SHARE INVESTMENT RESULTS AND RELATED STATISTICS

The fund's yield was 2.05% based on a 30-day (or one month) period ended
December 31, 2002, computed by dividing the net investment income per share
earned during the period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day
of the period, according to the following formula as required by the Securities
and Exchange Commission:


     YIELD = 2[((a-b)/cd + 1)/6/ -1]

     Where:  a   = dividends and interest earned during the period.

             b   = expenses accrued for the period (net of reimbursements).

             c   = the average daily number of shares outstanding during the
                   period that were entitled to receive dividends.

             d   = the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the
                   period.

The fund may also calculate a distribution rate on a taxable and tax equivalent
basis. The distribution rate is computed by dividing the dividends paid by the
fund over the last 12 months by the sum of the month-end net asset value or
maximum offering price and the capital gains paid over the last 12 months. The
distribution rate may differ from the yield.


The fund's one-year total return and five- and ten-year average annual total
returns at the maximum offering price for the periods ended December 31, 2002
were -22.08%, 1.33% and 10.06%, respectively.  The fund's one-year total return
and five- and ten-year average annual total returns at net asset value for the
periods ended December 31, 2002 were -17.34%, 2.54% and 10.72%, respectively.



The average total return ("T") is computed by equating the value at the end of
the period ("ERV") with a hypothetical initial investment of $1,000 ("P") over a
period of years ("n") according to the following formula as required by the
Securities and Exchange Commission: P(1+T)/n/ = ERV.

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 36
<PAGE>



In calculating average annual total return at the maximum offering price, the
fund assumes: (1) deduction of the maximum sales load of 5.75% from the $1,000
initial investment; (2) reinvestment of dividends and distributions at net asset
value on the reinvestment date determined by the Board; and (3) a complete
redemption at the end of any period illustrated. In addition, the fund will
provide lifetime average total return figures. From time to time, the fund may
calculate investment results for Class B, C, F, 529 and R shares.


The fund may also, at times, calculate total return based on net asset value per
share (rather than the offering price), in which case the figure would not
reflect the effect of any sales charges which would have been paid if shares
were purchased during the period reflected in the computation. Consequently,
total return calculated in this manner will be higher. These total returns may
be calculated over periods in addition to those described above. Total return
for the unmanaged indices will be calculated assuming reinvestment of dividends
and interest, but will not reflect any deductions for advisory fees, brokerage
costs or administrative expenses.


The fund may include information on its investment results and/or comparisons of
its investment results to various unmanaged indices (such as the Dow Jones
Average of 30 Industrial Stocks and the Standard and Poor's 500 Composite Stock
Index) or results of other mutual funds or investment or savings vehicles in
advertisements or in reports furnished to present or prospective shareholders.
The fund may also, from time to time, combine its results with those of other
funds in The American Funds Group for purposes of illustrating investment
strategies involving multiple funds.


The fund may refer to results and surveys compiled by organizations such as CDA/
Wiesenberger, Ibbotson Associates, Lipper Analytical Services, Morningstar,
Inc., and by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Additionally, the fund may refer
to results published in various newspapers and periodicals, including Barron's,
                                                                      --------
Forbes, Fortune, Institutional Investor, Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine,
------  -------  ----------------------  -------------------------------------
Money, U.S. News and World Report and The Wall Street Journal.
-----  --------------------------     -----------------------


The fund may illustrate the benefits of tax-deferral by comparing taxable
investments to investments made through tax-deferred retirement plans.


The fund may compare its investment results with the Consumer Price Index, which
is a measure of the average change in prices over time in a fixed market basket
of goods and services (e.g. food, clothing, fuels, transportation, and other
goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living).

                                    APPENDIX

                          DESCRIPTION OF BOND RATINGS

BOND RATINGS - The ratings of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") and
Standard & Poor's Corporation ("Standard & Poor's") are based on the analysis
and represents a judgment expressed in shorthand terms of the strengths and
weaknesses of the bonds which they undertake to rate. It should be emphasized,
however, that ratings are general and are not absolute standards of quality.


Moody's rates the long-term debt securities issued by various entities from
-------
"Aaa" to "C." Moody's applies the numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 in each
generic rating classification from Aa through B in its corporate bond rating
system. The modifier 1 indicates that the security ranks in the higher end of
its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and
the modifier 3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic
rating category. Ratings are described as follows:


"Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be of the best quality. They carry the
smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as 'gilt edge.'
Interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin,
and principal is secure. While the various protective elements are likely to
change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the
fundamentally strong position of such issues."


"Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards.
Together with the Aaa group, they comprise what are generally known as
high-grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of
protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities, or fluctuation of
protective elements may be of greater amplitude, or there may be other elements
present which make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than the Aaa
securities."


"Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and are to
be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors giving security to
principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present
which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future."


"Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade obligations, i.e.,
they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payments and
principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and, in
fact, have speculative characteristics as well."


"Bonds which are rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements; their future
cannot be considered as well assured. Often the protection of interest and
principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during
both good and bad times over the future. Uncertainty of position characterizes
bonds in this class."


"Bonds which are rated B generally lack characteristics of the desirable
investment. Assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of
other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small."

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 38
<PAGE>


"Bonds which are rated Caa are of poor standing. Such issues may be in default
or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or
interest."


"Bonds which are rated Ca represent obligations which are speculative in a high
degree. Such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings."


"Bonds which are rated C are the lowest rated class of bonds, and issues so
rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever attaining any
real investment standing."


Standard & Poor's rates the long-term debt securities of various entities in
-----------------
categories ranging from "AAA" to "D" according to quality. The ratings from "AA"
to "CCC" may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show
relative standing within the major rating categories. Ratings are described as
follows:


AAA
"An obligation rated 'AAA' has the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's.
The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is
extremely strong."


AA
"An obligation rated 'AA' differs from the highest rated obligations only in a
small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation is very strong."


A

"An obligation rated 'A' is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of
changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher
rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is still strong."


BBB
"An obligation rated 'BBB' exhibits adequate protection parameters. However,
adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to
a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation. Obligations rated 'BB', 'B', 'CCC', 'CC' and 'C' are regarded as
having significant speculative characteristics. 'BB' indicates the least degree
of speculation and 'C' the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions."


BB
"An obligation rated 'BB' is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to
adverse business, financial or economic conditions which could lead to the
obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation."

B
"An obligation rated 'B' is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated
'BB' but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment
on the obligation. Adverse business, financial or economic conditions will
likely impair the obligor's capacity or willingness to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation."

                         Fundamental Investors - Page 39
<PAGE>


CCC
"An obligation rated 'CCC' is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is
dependent upon favorable business, financial and economic conditions for the
obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of
adverse business, financial or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely to
have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation."

CC
"An obligation rated 'CC' is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment."

C

"A subordinated debt or preferred stock obligation rated 'C' is currently highly
vulnerable to nonpayment. The 'C' rating may be used to cover a situation where
a bankruptcy petition has been filed or similar action taken but payments on
this obligation are being continued. A 'C' also will be assigned to a preferred
stock issue in arrears on dividends or sinking fund payments but that is
currently paying."

D
"An obligation rated 'D' is in payment default. The 'D' rating category is used
when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the
applicable grace period has not expired, unless Standard & Poor's believes that
such payments will be made during such grace period. The 'D' rating also will be
used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action
if payments on an obligation are jeopardized."

1. Organization and significant accounting policies

Organization - Fundamental Investors, Inc. (the "fund") is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end, diversified management investment
company. The fund seeks long-term growth of capital and income primarily through
investments in common stocks.

The fund offers 14 share classes consisting of four retail share classes, five
CollegeAmerica savings plan share classes and five retirement plan share
classes. The CollegeAmerica savings plan share classes (529-A, 529-B, 529-C,
529-E and 529-F) are sponsored by the Commonwealth of Virginia and can be
utilized to save for college education. The five retirement plan share classes
(R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4 and R-5) are sold without any sales charges and do not carry
any conversion rights. The fund's share classes are described below:

</TABLE>


Holders of all share classes have equal pro rata rights to assets, dividends and
liquidation. Each share class has identical voting rights, except for the
exclusive right to vote on matters affecting only its class. Share classes have
different fees and expenses ("class-specific fees and expenses"), primarily due
to different arrangements for distribution, administrative and shareholder
services. Differences in class-specific fees and expenses will result in
differences in net investment income and, therefore, the payment of different
per-share dividends by each class.

Significant accounting policies - The financial statements have been prepared to
comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These principles require management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. The following is a summary of the significant accounting
policies followed by the fund:

         Security valuation - Equity securities are valued at the last reported
         sale price on the broadest and most representative exchange or market
         on which such securities are traded, as determined by the fund's
         investment adviser, as of the close of business or, lacking any sales,
         at the last available bid price. Fixed-income securities are valued at
         prices obtained from a pricing service. However, where the investment
         adviser deems it appropriate, they will be valued at the mean quoted
         bid and asked prices or at prices for securities of comparable
         maturity, quality and type. Short-term securities maturing within 60
         days are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. The
         ability of the issuers of the debt securities held by the fund to meet
         their obligations may be affected by economic developments in a
         specific industry, state or region. Securities and other assets for
         which representative market quotations are not readily available are
         valued at fair value as determined in good faith by authority of the
         fund's Board of Directors.

         Security transactions and related investment income - Security
         transactions are recorded by the fund as of the date the trades are
         executed with brokers. Realized gains and losses from security
         transactions are determined based on the specific identified cost of
         the securities. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date
         and interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. Market
         discounts, premiums and original issue discounts on fixed-income
         securities are amortized daily over the expected life of the security.

         Class allocations - Income, fees and expenses (other than
         class-specific fees and expenses) and realized and unrealized gains and
         losses are allocated daily among the various share classes based on
         their relative net assets. Class-specific fees and expenses, such as
         distribution, administrative and shareholder services, are charged
         directly to the respective share class.

         Dividends and distributions to shareholders - Dividends and
         distributions paid to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend
         date.

         Non-U.S. currency translation - Assets and liabilities, including
         investment securities, denominated in non-U.S. currencies are
         translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the end
         of the reporting period. Purchases and sales of investment securities
         and income and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at the
         exchange rates on the dates of such transactions. In the accompanying
         financial statements, the effects of changes in non-U.S. exchange rates
         on investment securities are included with the net realized gain or
         loss and net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments.
         The realized gain or loss and unrealized appreciation or depreciation
         resulting from all other transactions denominated in non-U.S.
         currencies are disclosed separately.


2. Non-U.S. investments

Investment risk - The risks of investing in securities of non-U.S. issuers may
include, but are not limited to, investment and repatriation restrictions;
revaluation of currencies; adverse political, social and economic developments;
government involvement in the private sector; limited and less reliable investor
information; lack of liquidity; certain local tax law considerations; and
limited regulation of the securities markets.

Taxation - Dividend and interest income is recorded net of non-U.S. taxes paid.


3. Federal income taxation and distributions

The fund complies with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code applicable to mutual funds and intends to distribute substantially
all of its net taxable income and net capital gains each year. The fund is not
subject to income taxes to the extent such distributions are made.

Distributions - Distributions paid to shareholders are based on net investment
income and net realized gains determined on a tax basis, which may differ from
net investment income and net realized gains for financial reporting purposes.
These differences are due primarily to differing treatment for items such as
non-U.S. currency gains and losses; short-term capital gains and losses; capital
losses related to sales of securities within 30 days of purchase; scheduled
interest payments not received; expenses deferred for tax purposes; cost of
investments sold and net capital losses. The fiscal year in which amounts are
distributed may differ from the year in which the net investment income and net
realized gains are recorded by the fund. As of December 31, 2002, the cost of
investment securities for federal income tax purposes was $18,566,244,000.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the fund reclassified $1,328,000 from
distributions in excess of net investment income to accumulated net realized
loss to align financial reporting with tax reporting.

As of December 31, 2002, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:

</TABLE>

Short-term and long-term capital loss deferrals above include capital loss
carryforwards of $95,779,000 and $577,387,000 expiring in 2009 and 2010,
respectively. The capital loss carryforwards will be used to offset any capital
gains realized by the fund in future years through the expiration dates. The
fund will not make distributions from capital gains while capital loss
carryforwards remain. Also included are capital losses of $127,678,000 that were
realized during the period November 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002.

The tax character of distributions paid to shareholders was as follows (dollars

4. Fees and transactions with related parties

Capital Research and Management Company ("CRMC"), the fund's investment adviser,
is the parent company of American Funds Service Company ("AFS"), the fund's
transfer agent, and American Funds Distributors ("AFD"), the principal
underwriter of the fund's shares.

Investment advisory services - The Investment Advisory and Service Agreement
with CRMC provides for monthly fees accrued daily. These fees are based on a
declining series of annual rates beginning with 0.390% on the first $1 billion
of daily net assets and decreasing to 0.246% on such assets in excess of $27
billion. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the investment advisory services
fee was equivalent to an annualized rate of 0.273% of average daily net assets.

Class-specific fees and expenses - Expenses that are specific to individual
share classes are accrued directly to the respective share class. The principal
class-specific fees and expenses are described below:

         Distribution services - The fund has adopted plans of distribution for
         all share classes, except Class R-5. Under the plans, the Board of
         Directors approves certain categories of expenses that are used to
         finance activities primarily intended to sell fund shares. The plans
         provide for annual expenses, based on a percentage of average daily net
         assets, ranging from 0.25% to 1.00% as noted on the next page. In some
         cases, the Board of Directors has approved expense amounts lower than
         plan limits.

</TABLE>

         All share classes may use up to 0.25% of these expenses to pay service
         fees, or to compensate AFD for paying service fees, to firms that have
         entered into agreements with AFD for providing certain shareholder
         services. Expenses in excess of these amounts, up to approved limits,
         may be used to compensate dealers and wholesalers for shares sold.

         For classes A and 529-A, the Board of Directors has also approved the
         reimbursement of dealer and wholesaler commissions paid by AFD for
         certain shares sold without a sales charge. Each class reimburses AFD
         for amounts billed within the prior 15 months but only to the extent
         that the overall annual expense limit of 0.25% is not exceeded. As of
         December 31, 2002, there were no unreimbursed expenses which remain
         subject to reimbursement for Class A or for Class 529-A.

         Transfer agent services - The fund has a transfer agent agreement with
         AFS for Class A and B shares. Under this agreement, these share classes
         compensate AFS for transfer agent services including shareholder
         recordkeeping, communications and transaction processing. AFS is also
         compensated for certain transfer agent services provided to all other
         share classes from the administrative services fees paid to CRMC
         described below.

         Administrative services - The fund has an administrative services
         agreement with CRMC to provide transfer agent and other related
         shareholder services for all classes of shares other than classes A and
         B. Each relevant class pays CRMC annual fees of 0.15% (0.10% for Class
         R-5) based on its respective average daily net assets. Each relevant
         class also pays AFS additional amounts for certain transfer agent
         services. CRMC and AFS may use these fees to compensate third parties
         for performing these services. During the start-up period for classes
         R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4, CRMC has voluntarily agreed to pay a portion of
         these fees. Each 529 share class is subject to an additional annual
         administrative fee of 0.10% of its respective average daily net assets;
         this fee is payable to the Commonwealth of Virginia for the maintenance
         of the CollegeAmerica plan. Administrative services fees are presented
         gross of any payments made by CRMC.

         Expenses under the agreements described above for the year ended
         December 31, 2002, were as follows (dollars in thousands):

     *Amount less than one thousand.

Deferred Directors' compensation - Since the adoption of the deferred
compensation plan in 1993, Directors who are unaffiliated with CRMC may elect to
defer the cash payment of part or all of their compensation. These deferred
amounts, which remain as liabilities of the fund, are treated as if invested in
shares of the fund or other American Funds. These amounts represent general,
unsecured liabilities of the fund and vary according to the total returns of the
selected funds. Directors' fees in the accompanying financial statements include
the current fees (either paid in cash or deferred) and the net increase or
decrease in the value of the deferred amounts.

Affiliated officers and Directors - Officers and certain Directors of the fund
are or may be considered to be affiliated with CRMC, AFS and AFD. No affiliated
officers or Directors received any compensation directly from the fund.

Independent Auditors' Report

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Fundamental Investors, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
Fundamental Investors, Inc. (the "Fund"), including the investment portfolio, as
of December 31, 2002, and the related statement of operations for the year then
ended, the statement of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are
the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of December 31, 2002, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers; where replies were not received from brokers, we performed other
auditing procedures. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Fundamental Investors, Inc. as of December 31, 2002, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of
the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Item 24.    Persons Controlled by or under Common Control with Registrant

            None

Item 25.    Indemnification

                  The registrant is a joint-insured under Investment
Adviser/Mutual fund Errors and Omissions Policies, which insures its officers
and directors against certain liabilities. However, in no event will Registrant
maintain insurance to indemnify any such person for any act for which Registrant
itself is not permitted to indemnify the individual.

                  The fund's Articles of Incorporation state:

                  The Corporation shall indemnify (1) its directors and
officers, whether serving the Corporation or at its request any other entity, to
the full extent required or permitted by the General Laws of the State of
Maryland now or hereafter in force, including the advance of expenses under the
procedures and to the full extent permitted by law, and (2) its other employees
and agents to such extent as shall be authorized by the Board of Directors or
the Corporation's By-Laws and be permitted by law. The foregoing rights of
indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which those
seeking indemnification may be entitled. The Board of Directors may take such
action as is necessary to carry out these indemnification provisions and is
expressly empowered to adopt, approve and amend from time to time such by-laws,
resolutions or contracts implementing such provisions or such further
indemnification arrangements as may be permitted by law. No amendment of this
Charter of the Corporation shall limit or eliminate the right to indemnification
provided hereunder with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such
amendment or repeal. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to authorize
the Corporation to indemnify any director or officer of the Corporation against
any liability to the Corporation or to any holders of securities of the
Corporation to which he is subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith,
gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of
his office. Any indemnification by the Corporation shall be consistent with the
requirements of law, including the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

                  To the fullest extent permitted by Maryland statutory and
decisional law and the 1940 Act, as amended or interpreted, no director or
officer of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for money damages; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be
construed to protect any director or officer of the Corporation against any
liability to which such director or officer would otherwise be subject by reason
of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of
the duties involved in the conduct of his office. No amendment, modification or
repeal of this Article VIII shall adversely affect any right or protection of a
director or officer that exists at the time of such amendment, modification or
repeal.

                  Section 2-418 (b) of The Annotated Code of Maryland states:

                  Permitted indemnification of director:

                  1.     A corporation may indemnify any director made a party
                         to any proceeding by reason of service in that capacity
                         unless it is established that:


                                       Fundamental Investors, Inc. -- C-2


<PAGE>



                         (i)   The act or omission of the director was material
                               to the matter giving rise to the proceeding; and

                               1. Was committed in bad faith; or
                               2. Was the result of active and deliberate
                                  dishonesty; or

                         (ii)  The director actually received an improper
                               personal benefit in money, property, or services;
                               or

                         (iii) In the case of any criminal proceeding, the
                               director had reasonable cause to believe that the
                               act or omission was unlawful.

                  2.     (i)   Indemnification may be against judgments,
                               penalties, fines, settlements, and reasonable
                               expenses actually incurred by the director in
                               connection with the proceeding.

                         (ii)  However, if the proceeding was one by or in the
                               right of the corporation, indemnification may not
                               be made in respect of any proceeding in which the
                               director shall have been adjudged to be liable to
                               the corporation.

     Insofar as  indemnification  for liability arising under the Securities Act
of 1933 may be permitted to Directors,  officers and controlling  persons of the
Registrant pursuant to the foregoing  provisions,  or otherwise,  the Registrant
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities  and Exchange  Commission
such  indemnification  is against  public policy as expressed in the Act and is,
therefore,  unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against
such liabilities  (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred
or paid by a Director,  officer or  controlling  person of the registrant in the
successful  defense of any  action,  suit or  proceeding)  is  asserted  by such
Director,  officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
has been  settled by  controlling  precedent,  submit to a court of  appropriate
jurisdiction the question whether such  indemnification  by it is against public
policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of
such issue.

     Registrant will comply with the indemnification  requirements  contained in
the Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended,  and Release Nos. 7221 (June 9,
1972) and  11330  (September  4,  1980).  In  addition,  indemnification  by the
Registrant  shall be  consistent  with the  requirements  of rule 484  under the
Securities Act of 1933.
