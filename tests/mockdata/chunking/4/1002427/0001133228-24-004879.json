appreciation.\n\nFees and Expenses\n\nThe table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the Fund.\n\nYou may pay fees other than the fees and expenses of the Fund, such as brokerage commissions and other fees charged by financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the tables and examples below.", "For purchases of Class A shares, you may qualify for a sales charge discount if the cumulative net asset value per share (\u201cNAV\u201d) of Class A shares of the Fund being purchased in a single transaction, together with the NAV of any shares of the Fund and/or certain other Morgan Stanley Funds already held in Related Accounts (as defined in the section of the Prospectus entitled \u201cShareholder Information\u2014Share Class Arrangements\u201d) as of the date of the transaction, amounts to $50,000 or more.\n\nMore information about this combined purchase discount and other discounts is available from your financial intermediary and on page 27 of the Prospectus in the section entitled \u201cShareholder Information\u2014Share Class Arrangements.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Appendix A attached to the Prospectus contains information regarding Financial Intermediary-specific sales charge waivers and discounts.", "Class I shares may be available on brokerage platforms of firms that have agreements with the Fund\u2019s principal underwriter permitting such firms to (i) offer Class I shares solely when acting as an agent for the investor and (ii) impose on an investor transacting in Class I shares through such platforms a commission and/or other forms of compensation to the broker.\n\nShares of the Fund are available in other share classes that have different fees and expenses.\n\nShareholder Fees (fees

investing in other mutual funds.\n\nThe example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund, your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s operating expenses remain the same (except that the example incorporates the fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement arrangement for only the first year).", "After eight years, Class C shares of the Fund generally will convert automatically to Class A shares of the Fund.\n\nThe example for Class C shares reflects the conversion to Class A shares after eight years.\n\nPlease refer to the section of the Prospectus entitled

\u201cAdministrator,\u201d Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., has agreed to reduce its advisory fee, its administration fee and/or reimburse the Fund so that Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses, excluding acquired fund fees and expenses (as applicable), certain investment related expenses, taxes, interest and other extraordinary expenses (including litigation), will not exceed 1.27% for Class A, 1.77% for Class L, 0.92% for Class I, 2.02% for Class C and 0.85% for Class R6.", "The fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of this Prospectus or until such time as the Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements when it deems such action is appropriate.\n\nPortfolio Turnover\n\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio).\n\nA higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account.\n\nThese costs, which are not reflected in Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the example, affect the Fund\u2019s performance.\n\nDuring the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 40% of the average value of its portfolio.\n\nPrincipal Investment Strategies", "Under normal circumstances, the Fund\u2019s assets will be invested primarily in a portfolio of common stocks of companies with market capitalizations, at the time of purchase, within the capitalization range of the companies comprising the Russell 3000\u00ae Growth Index, which as of December 31, 2023 was between $19.7 million and $3.0 trillion.\n\nThe Adviser seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in established and emerging companies.\n\nThe Adviser emphasizes a bottom-up stock selection process, seeking attractive investments on an individual company basis.\n\nIn selecting securities for investment, the Adviser typically invests in unique companies it believes have sustainable competitive advantages with above average business visibility, the ability to deploy capital at high rates of return, strong balance sheets and an attractive risk/reward.\n\nThe Fund may invest in other types of equity securities.", "The Fund may, but it is not required to, use derivative instruments as discussed herein.\n\nThese derivative instruments will be counted toward the Fund\u2019s exposure in the types of securities listed herein to the extent they have economic characteristics similar to such securities.\n\nThe Adviser typically focuses a significant portion of the Fund\u2019s investments in a limited number of issuers, which may be in the same industry, sector or geographic region.\n\nThe Adviser actively integrates sustainability into the investment process by using environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) factors as a lens for additional fundamental research, which can contribute to investment decision-making.\n\nThe Adviser seeks to understand how environmental and social initiatives within companies can create value by strengthening durable competitive advantages, creating growth opportunities, driving profitability and/or aligning with secular growth trends.", "The Adviser generally engages with company management teams to discuss their ESG practices, with the aim of identifying how sustainability themes present opportunities and risks that can be material to the value of the security over the long-term.\n\nOther aspects of the investment process include a proprietary, systematic evaluation of governance policies, specifically focusing on compensation alignment on long-\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus  |  Fund Summary\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\nterm value creation.\n\nAlthough consideration of ESG factors is incorporated into the investment process, it is only one of many tools the Adviser utilizes to make investment decisions.", "The Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in foreign securities, including emerging market securities and securities classified as American Depositary Receipts (\u201cADRs\u201d), Global Depositary Receipts (\u201cGDRs\u201d), American Depositary Shares (\u201cADSs\u201d) or Global Depositary Shares (\u201cGDSs\u201d), foreign U.S. dollar-denominated securities that are traded on a U.S. exchange or local shares of non-U.S. issuers.\n\nThe Fund may invest in privately placed and restricted securities.\n\nPrincipal Risks\n\nThere is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective, and you can lose money investing in this Fund.\n\nThe principal risks of investing in the Fund include:\n\n\u2022 |  Equity Securities.\n\nIn general, prices of equity securities are more volatile than those of fixed-income securities.", "The prices of equity securities fluctuate, and sometimes widely fluctuate, in response to activities specific to the issuer of the security as well as factors unrelated to the fundamental condition of the issuer, including general market, economic, political conditions and public health conditions.\n\nDuring periods when equity securities experience heightened volatility, such as during periods of market, economic or financial uncertainty or distress, the Fund\u2019s investments in equity securities may be subject to heightened risks.\n\n|  The value of equity securities and related instruments may decline in response to adverse changes in the economy or the economic outlook; deterioration in investor sentiment; interest rate, currency, and commodity price fluctuations; adverse geopolitical, social or environmental developments; issuer- and sector-specific considerations; unexpected trading activity among retail investors; and other factors.", "Market conditions may affect certain types of stocks to a greater extent than other types of stocks.\n\nIf the stock market declines, the value of Fund shares will also likely decline.\n\n\u2022 |  Small and Mid Cap Companies.\n\nInvestments in small and mid cap companies may involve greater risks than investments in larger, more established companies.\n\nThe securities issued by small and mid cap companies may be less liquid and such companies may have more limited markets, financial resources and product lines, and may lack the depth of management of larger companies.\n\n\u2022 |  Foreign and Emerging Market Securities.\n\nInvestments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political (including geopolitical), economic and market risks.", "There also may be greater market volatility, less reliable financial information, less stringent investor protections and disclosure standards, higher transaction and custody costs, decreased market liquidity and less government and exchange regulation associated with investments in foreign markets.\n\nIn addition, investments in certain foreign markets that have historically been considered stable may become more volatile and subject to increased risk due to developments and changing conditions in such markets.\n\nMoreover, the growing interconnectivity of global economies and financial markets has increased the probability that adverse developments and conditions in one country or region will affect the stability of economies and financial markets in other countries or regions.", "Certain foreign markets may rely heavily on particular industries or foreign capital and are more vulnerable to diplomatic developments, the imposition of economic sanctions against a particular country or countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals, changes in international trading patterns, trade barriers and other protectionist or retaliatory measures.\n\nInvestments in foreign markets may also be adversely affected by governmental actions such as the imposition of capital controls, nationalization of companies or industries, expropriation of assets or the imposition of punitive taxes.\n\nThe governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investing in their capital markets or in certain sectors or industries.", "In addition, a foreign government may limit or cause delay in the convertibility or repatriation of its currency which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value and/or liquidity of investments denominated in that currency.\n\nCertain foreign investments may become less liquid in response to market developments or adverse investor perceptions, or become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil.\n\nWhen the Fund holds illiquid investments, its portfolio may be harder to value.\n\nThe risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries.\n\nCertain emerging market countries may be subject to less stringent requirements regarding accounting, auditing, financial reporting and record keeping and therefore, material information related to an investment may not be available or reliable.", "In addition, the Fund is limited in its ability to exercise its legal rights or enforce a counterparty\u2019s legal obligations in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States, in particular, in emerging market countries.\n\nIn addition, the Fund\u2019s investments in foreign issuers may be denominated in foreign currencies and therefore, to the extent unhedged, the value of those investments will fluctuate with U.S. dollar exchange rates.\n\nTo the extent hedged by the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts, the precise matching of the foreign currency forward exchange contract amounts and the value of the securities involved will not generally be possible because the future value of such securities in foreign currencies will change as a consequence of market movements in the value of those securities between the date on which the contract is entered into and the date it matures.", "There is additional risk that such transactions may reduce or preclude the opportunity for gain if the value of the currency should move in the direction opposite to the position taken and that foreign currency forward exchange contracts create exposure to currencies in which the Fund\u2019s securities are not denominated.\n\nThe use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts involves the risk of loss from the insolvency or bankruptcy of the counterparty to the contract or the failure of the counterparty to make payments or otherwise comply with the terms of the contract.\n\nEconomic sanctions or other similar measures may be, and have been, imposed against certain countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus | Fund Summary\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)", "|  Economic sanctions and other similar measures could, among other things, effectively restrict or eliminate the Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or sell securities, negatively impact the value or liquidity of the Fund\u2019s investments, significantly delay or prevent the settlement of the Fund\u2019s securities transactions, force the Fund to sell or otherwise dispose of investments at inopportune times or prices, or impair the Fund\u2019s ability to meet its investment objective or invest in accordance with its investment strategies.\n\n\u2022 |  Liquidity.\n\nThe Fund may make investments that are illiquid or restricted or that may become illiquid or less liquid in response to overall economic conditions or adverse investor perceptions, and which may entail greater risk than investments in other types of securities.\n\nThese investments may be more difficult to value or sell, particularly in times of market turmoil, and there may be little trading in the secondary market available for particular securities.", "If the Fund is forced to sell an illiquid or restricted security to fund redemptions or for other cash needs, it may be forced to sell the security at a loss or for less than its fair value and may be unable to sell the security at all.\n\n\u2022 |  Focused Investing.\n\nAlthough the Fund is a diversified investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), the Fund typically invests a significant portion of its portfolio in a limited number of issuers, which may be in the same industry, sector or geographic region.\n\nAs a result, the Fund will be more susceptible to risks associated with, and negative events affecting those issuers, industries, sectors or geographic regions, and a decline in the value of a particular instrument may cause the Fund\u2019s overall value to be more volatile and decline to a greater degree than if the Fund were invested more widely.\n\n\u2022 |  Private Placements and Restricted Securities.", "The Fund\u2019s investments may include privately placed securities, which are subject to resale restrictions.\n\nThese securities could have the effect of increasing the level of Fund illiquidity to the extent the Fund may be unable to sell or transfer these securities due to restrictions on transfers or on the ability to find buyers interested in purchasing the securities.\n\nAdditionally, the market for certain investments deemed liquid at the time of purchase may become illiquid under adverse market or economic conditions.\n\n\u2022 |  Information Technology Sector Risk.", "To the extent the Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the information technology sector, the value of Fund shares may be particularly impacted by events that adversely affect the information technology sector, such as rapid changes in technology product cycles, product obsolescence, government regulation, and competition, and may fluctuate more than that of a fund that does not invest significantly in companies in the technology sector.\n\n\u2022 |  Market and Geopolitical Risk.\n\nThe value of your investment in the Fund is based on the values of the Fund\u2019s investments, which change due to economic and other events that affect markets generally, as well as those that affect particular regions, countries, industries, companies or governments.\n\nThese events may be sudden and unexpected, and could adversely affect the liquidity of the Fund\u2019s investments, which may in turn impact valuation, the Fund\u2019s ability to sell securities and/or its ability to meet redemptions.", "The risks associated with these developments may be magnified if certain social, political, economic and other conditions and events (such as war, natural disasters, epidemics and pandemics, terrorism, conflicts, social unrest, recessions, inflation, interest rate changes and supply chain disruptions) adversely interrupt the global economy and financial markets.\n\nIt is difficult to predict when events affecting the U.S. or global financial markets may occur, the effects that such events may have and the duration of those effects (which may last for extended periods).\n\nThese events may negatively impact broad segments of businesses and populations and have a significant and rapid negative impact on the performance of the Fund\u2019s investments, adversely affect and increase the volatility of the Fund\u2019s share price and exacerbate pre-existing risks to the Fund.\n\n\u2022 |  Active Management Risk.", "In pursuing the Fund\u2019s investment objective, the Adviser has considerable leeway in deciding which investments to buy, hold or sell on a day-to-day basis, and which trading strategies to use.\n\nFor example, the Adviser, in its discretion, may determine to use some permitted trading strategies while not using others.\n\nThe success or failure of such decisions will affect the Fund\u2019s performance.\n\nShares of the Fund are not bank deposits and are not guaranteed or insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\n\nPast Performance\n\nThe bar chart and table below provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund\u2019s Class A shares\u2019 performance from year-to-year and by showing how the Fund\u2019s average annual returns for the past one, five and 10 year periods and since inception compare with those of one or more indexes intended to measure broad market performance.", "The Fund\u2019s primary benchmark index was changed from the Russell 3000\u00ae Growth Index to the Russell 3000\u00ae Index effective April 30, 2024 to comply with the regulation that requires the Fund\u2019s primary benchmark to represent the overall applicable market.\n\nThe additional index in the table provides a means to compare the Fund\u2019s average annual returns to a benchmark that the Adviser believes is representative of the Fund\u2019s investment universe.\n\nThe performance of the other classes, which is shown in the table below, will differ because the classes have different ongoing fees.\n\nThe performance information in the bar chart does not reflect the deduction of sales charges; if these amounts were reflected, returns would be less than shown.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s returns in the table include the maximum applicable sales charge for Class A and Class C and assume you sold your shares at the end of each period (unless otherwise noted).", "The Fund\u2019s past performance, before and after taxes, is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future.\n\nUpdated performance

Information about Fund Investment Objective, Strategies and Related Risks\n\nInvestment Objective\n\nMorgan Stanley Insight Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation.\n\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the Fund\u2019s assets will be invested primarily in a portfolio of common stocks of companies with market capitalizations, at the time of purchase, within the capitalization range of the companies comprising the Russell 3000\u00ae Growth Index, which as of December 31, 2023 was between $19.7 million and $3.0 trillion.\n\nThe Adviser seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in established and emerging companies.\n\nThe Adviser emphasizes a bottom-up stock selection process, seeking attractive investments on an individual company basis.", "In selecting securities for investment, the Adviser typically invests in unique companies it believes have sustainable competitive advantages with above average business visibility, the ability to deploy capital at high rates of return, strong balance sheets and an attractive risk/reward.\n\nThe Fund may invest in other types of equity securities.\n\nThe Fund may, but it is not required to, use derivative instruments as discussed herein.\n\nThese derivative instruments will be counted toward the Fund\u2019s exposure in the types of securities listed herein to the extent they have economic characteristics similar to such securities.\n\nThe Adviser typically focuses a significant portion of the Fund\u2019s investments in a limited number of issuers, which may be in the same industry, sector or geographic region.\n\nThe Adviser generally considers selling an investment when it determines the company no longer satisfies its investment criteria.", "The Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in foreign securities, including emerging market securities and securities classified as ADRs, GDRs, ADSs or GDSs, foreign U.S. dollar-denominated securities that are traded on a U.S. exchange or local shares of non-U.S. issuers.\n\nThe Fund may invest in privately placed and restricted securities.\n\nThe Adviser actively integrates sustainability into the investment process by using ESG factors as a lens for additional fundamental research, which can contribute to investment decision-making.\n\nThe Adviser seeks to understand how environmental and social initiatives within companies can create value by strengthening durable competitive advantages, creating growth opportunities, driving profitability and/or aligning with secular growth trends.", "The Adviser generally engages with company management teams to discuss their ESG practices, with the aim of identifying how sustainability themes present opportunities and risks that can be material to the value of the security over the long-term.\n\nOther aspects of the investment process include a proprietary, systematic evaluation of governance policies, specifically focusing on compensation alignment on long-term value creation.\n\nAlthough consideration of ESG factors is incorporated into the investment process, it is only one of many tools the Adviser utilizes to make investment decisions.\n\nCommon stock is a share ownership or equity interest in a corporation.\n\nIt may or may not pay dividends, as some companies reinvest all of their profits back into their businesses, while others pay out some of their profits to shareholders as dividends.", "In pursuing the Fund\u2019s investment objective, the Adviser has considerable leeway in deciding which investments it buys, holds or sells on a day-to-day basis and which trading strategies it uses.\n\nFor example, the Adviser in its discretion may determine to use some permitted trading strategies while not using others.\n\nAdditional Information About Fund Investment Strategies and Principal Risks\n\nThis section discusses additional information relating to the Fund\u2019s investment strategies, other types of investments that the Fund may make and related risk factors.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s investment practices and limitations are also described in more detail in the Statement of Additional Information (\u201cSAI\u201d), which is incorporated by reference and legally is a part of this Prospectus.\n\nFor details on how to obtain a copy of the SAI and other reports and information, see the back cover of this Prospectus.", "Economies and financial markets worldwide have recently experienced periods of increased volatility, uncertainty, distress, government spending, inflation and disruption to consumer demand, economic output and supply chains.\n\nTo the extent these conditions continue, the risks associated with an investment in the Fund, including those described below, could be heightened and the Fund\u2019s investments (and thus a shareholder\u2019s investment in the Fund) may be particularly susceptible to sudden and substantial losses, reduced yield or income or other adverse developments.\n\nThe occurrence, duration and extent of these or other types of adverse economic and market conditions and uncertainty over the long term cannot be reasonably projected or estimated at this time.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus | Fund Details\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\nFixed-Income Securities.\n\nThe Fund also may invest up to 35% of its net assets in investment grade fixed-income securities.", "Fixed-income securities are debt securities such as bonds, notes or commercial paper.\n\nThe issuer of the debt security borrows money from the investor who buys the security.\n\nMost debt securities pay either fixed or adjustable rates of interest at regular intervals until they mature, at which point investors get their principal back.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s fixed-income investments may include zero coupon securities.\n\nREITs and Foreign Real Estate Companies.\n\nThe Fund may invest in real estate investment trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d) and foreign real estate companies, which are similar to entities organized and operated as REITs in the United States.\n\nREITs and foreign real estate companies pool investor funds for investments primarily in real estate properties or real estate-related loans.\n\nThey may also include among other businesses, real estate developers, brokers and operating companies whose products and services are significantly related to the real estate industry such as building suppliers and mortgage lenders.", "Derivatives.\n\nThe Fund may, but it is not required to, use derivative instruments for a variety of purposes, including hedging, risk management, portfolio management or to seek to earn income.\n\nA derivative is a financial instrument whose value is based, in part, on the value of an underlying asset, interest rate, index or financial instrument.\n\nPrevailing interest rates and volatility levels, among other things, also affect the value of derivative instruments.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s use of derivatives may involve the purchase and sale of derivative instruments such as futures, options, swaps, structured investments and other related instruments and techniques.\n\nTemporary Defensive Investments", "Under adverse or unstable market conditions or abnormal circumstances or when the Adviser believes that changes in market, economic, political or other conditions warrant, the Fund may, in the discretion of the Adviser, take temporary positions that are inconsistent with the Fund\u2019s principal investment strategy in attempting to respond to such conditions or circumstances.\n\nFor example, the Fund may invest without limit in cash, cash equivalents or other fixed-income instruments, derivatives, repurchase agreements or securities of other investment companies (including those which may be managed by the Adviser or its affiliates), including money market funds, for temporary purposes.\n\nIf the Adviser incorrectly predicts the effects of these changes or during periods of temporary defensive or other temporary positions, such temporary investments may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s performance and the Fund may not achieve its investment objective.", "The percentage limitations relating to the composition of the Fund\u2019s portfolio apply at the time the Fund acquires an investment.\n\nSubsequent percentage changes that result from market fluctuations generally will not require the Fund to sell any portfolio security.\n\nHowever, the Fund may be required to reduce its borrowings, if any, in response to fluctuations in the value of such holdings.\n\nThe Fund may change its principal investment strategies without shareholder approval; however, you would be notified of any changes.\n\nAdditional Information About the Fund\n\nThere is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s share price and return will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities.\n\nWhen you sell Fund shares, they may be worth less than what you paid for them and, accordingly, you can lose money investing in this Fund.\n\nEquity Securities", "Equity securities may include common and preferred stocks, convertible securities and equity-linked securities, rights and warrants to purchase common stocks, depositary receipts, shares of investment companies, limited partnership interests and other specialty securities having equity features.\n\nMany factors affect the value of equity securities, including earnings, earnings forecasts, corporate events and factors impacting the issuer\u2019s industry and the market generally.\n\nThe Fund may invest in equity securities that are publicly traded on securities exchanges or over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) or in equity securities that are not publicly traded.\n\nSecurities that are not publicly traded may be more difficult to value or sell and their value may fluctuate more dramatically than other securities.\n\nThe prices of convertible securities are affected by changes similar to those of equity and fixed-income securities.", "The value of equity securities and related instruments may decline in response to adverse changes in the economy or the economic outlook; deterioration in investor sentiment; interest rate, currency, and commodity price fluctuations; adverse geopolitical, social or environmental developments; issuer- and sector-specific considerations; unexpected trading activity among retail investors; and other factors.\n\nMarket conditions may affect certain types of stocks to a greater extent than other types of stocks.\n\nIf the stock market declines, the value of Fund shares will also likely decline.\n\nAlthough stock prices can rebound, there is no assurance that values will return to previous levels.\n\nDuring periods when equity securities experience heightened volatility, such as during periods of market, economic or financial uncertainty or distress, the Fund\u2019s investments in equity securities may be subject to heightened risks.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus  |  Fund Details", "Insight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\nDepositary Receipts\n\nA depositary receipt is generally issued by a bank or financial institution and represents the common stock or other equity securities of a foreign company.\n\nDepositary receipts involve many of the same risks as those associated with direct investment in foreign securities.\n\nIn addition, the underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts, particularly unsponsored or unregistered depositary receipts, are under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications to the holders of such receipts, or to pass through to them any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities.\n\nConvertible Securities\n\nA convertible security is a bond, debenture, note, preferred stock, right, warrant or other security that may be converted into or exchanged for a prescribed amount of common stock or other security of the same or a different issuer or into cash within a particular period of time at a specified price or formula.", "A convertible security generally entitles the holder to receive interest paid or accrued on debt securities or the dividend paid on preferred stock until the convertible security matures or is redeemed, converted or exchanged.\n\nBefore conversion, convertible securities generally have characteristics similar to both debt and equity securities.\n\nThe value of convertible securities tends to decline as interest rates rise and, because of the conversion feature, tends to vary with fluctuations in the market value of the underlying securities.\n\nConvertible securities ordinarily provide a stream of income with generally higher yields than those of common stock of the same or similar issuers.\n\nConvertible securities generally rank senior to common stock in a corporation\u2019s capital structure but are usually subordinated to other comparable nonconvertible fixed-income securities in such capital structure.", "Convertible securities generally do not participate directly in any dividend increases or decreases of the underlying securities although the market prices of convertible securities may be affected by any dividend changes or other changes in the underlying securities.\n\nSmall and Mid Cap Companies\n\nThe Fund\u2019s investments in small and mid cap companies carry more risk than investments in larger companies.\n\nWhile some of the Fund\u2019s holdings in these companies may be listed on a national securities exchange, such securities are more likely to be traded in the OTC market.\n\nThe low market liquidity of these securities may have an adverse impact on the Fund\u2019s ability to sell certain securities at favorable prices and may also make it difficult for the Fund to obtain market quotations based on actual trades for purposes of valuing the Fund\u2019s securities.", "Investing in lesser-known, small and mid cap companies involves greater risk of volatility of the Fund\u2019s NAV than is customarily associated with larger, more established companies.\n\nIn addition, at times, small and mid cap growth-oriented equity securities may underperform relative to the overall market.\n\nGrowth stocks may trade at higher multiples of current earnings compared to other styles of investing (e.g., \u201cvalue\u201d), leading to inflated prices and thus potentially greater declines in value.\n\nOften small and mid cap companies and the industries in which they are focused are still evolving and, while this may offer better growth potential than larger, more established companies, it also may make them more sensitive to changing market conditions.\n\nForeign Securities\n\nForeign issuers generally are subject to different accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards than U.S. issuers.\n\nThere may be less information available to the public about foreign issuers.", "Securities of foreign issuers can be less liquid and experience greater price movements.\n\nIn addition, the prices of such securities may be susceptible to influence by large traders, due to the limited size of many foreign securities markets.\n\nMoreover, investments in certain foreign markets that have historically been considered stable may become more volatile and subject to increased risk due to developments and changing conditions in such markets.\n\nAlso, the growing interconnectivity of global economies and financial markets has increased the probability that adverse developments and conditions in one country or region will affect the stability of economies and financial markets in other countries or regions.\n\nIn some foreign countries, there is also the risk of government expropriation, excessive taxation, political or social instability, the imposition of currency controls or diplomatic developments that could affect the Fund\u2019s investment.", "There also can be difficulty obtaining and enforcing judgments against issuers in foreign countries.\n\nForeign stock exchanges, broker-dealers and listed issuers may be subject to less government regulation and oversight.\n\nThe cost of investing in foreign securities, including brokerage commissions and custodial expenses, can be higher than the cost of investing in domestic securities.\n\nCertain foreign markets may rely heavily on particular industries or foreign capital and are more vulnerable to diplomatic developments, the imposition of economic sanctions against a particular country or countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals, changes in international trading patterns, trade barriers and other protectionist or retaliatory measures.\n\nInternational trade barriers or economic sanctions against foreign countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s foreign holdings or exposures.", "Investments in foreign markets may also be adversely affected by less stringent investor protections and disclosure standards, and governmental actions such as the imposition of capital controls, nationalization of companies or industries, expropriation of assets or the imposition of punitive taxes.\n\nGovernmental actions can have a significant effect on the economic conditions in foreign countries, which also may adversely affect the value and liquidity of the Fund\u2019s investments.\n\nForeign investment in the securities markets of certain foreign countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees.\n\nFor example, the governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investing in their capital markets or in certain sectors or industries.", "In addition, a foreign government may limit or cause delay in the convertibility or repatriation of its currency which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value and/or liquidity of investments denominated in that currency.\n\nMoreover, if a deterioration occurs in a country\u2019s balance of payments, the country could impose temporary restrictions on\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus | Fund Details\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\nforeign capital remittances.\n\nThe Fund could also be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required governmental approval for repatriation, as well as by the application to it of other restrictions on investment.\n\nAny of these actions could severely affect security prices, which could result in losses to the Fund and increased transaction costs, impair the Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or sell foreign securities or transfer the Fund\u2019s assets back into the United States, or otherwise adversely affect the Fund\u2019s operations.", "Certain foreign investments may become less liquid in response to market developments or adverse investor perceptions, or become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil.\n\nCertain foreign investments may become illiquid when, for instance, there are few, if any, interested buyers and sellers or when dealers are unwilling to make a market for certain securities.\n\nWhen the Fund holds illiquid investments, its portfolio may be harder to value.\n\nEconomic sanctions or other similar measures may be, and have been, imposed against certain countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s investments in foreign securities are subject to trade laws and potential economic sanctions in the United States and other jurisdictions.\n\nThese laws and related governmental actions, including counter-sanctions and other retaliatory measures, can, from time to time, prevent or prohibit the Fund from investing in certain foreign securities.", "In addition, economic sanctions could prohibit the Fund from transacting with particular countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals by banning them from global payment systems that facilitate cross-border payments, restricting their ability to settle securities transactions, and freezing their assets.\n\nThe imposition of sanctions and other similar measures could, among other things, cause a decline in the value of securities issued by the sanctioned country or companies located in, or economically linked to, the sanctioned country, downgrades in the credit ratings of the sanctioned country or companies located in, or economically linked to, the sanctioned country, devaluation of the sanctioned country\u2019s currency, and increased market volatility and disruption in the sanctioned country and throughout the world.", "Economic sanctions or other similar measures could, among other things, effectively restrict or eliminate the Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or sell securities, negatively impact the value or liquidity of the Fund\u2019s investments, significantly delay or prevent the settlement of the Fund\u2019s securities transactions, force the Fund to sell or otherwise dispose of investments at inopportune times or prices, increase the Fund\u2019s transaction costs, make the Fund\u2019s investments more difficult to value or impair the Fund\u2019s ability to meet its investment objective or invest in accordance with its investment strategies.\n\nThese conditions may be in place for a substantial period of time and enacted with limited advance notice to the Fund.", "Even if the Fund does not have significant investments in securities affected by sanctions, sanctions or the threat of sanctions may cause volatility in regional and global markets and may negatively impact the performance of various sectors and industries, as well as companies in other countries, including through global supply chain disruptions, increased inflationary pressures, and reduced economic activity, which could have a negative effect on the Fund\u2019s performance.\n\nIn addition, trade disputes may affect investor and consumer confidence and adversely affect financial markets and the broader economy, perhaps suddenly and to a significant degree.\n\nEvents such as these and their impact on the Fund are difficult to predict.", "In addition, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the \u201cHFCAA\u201d) could cause securities of a foreign (non-U.S.) company, including American Depositary Receipts, to be delisted from U.S. stock exchanges if the company does not allow the U.S. government to oversee the auditing of its financial information.\n\nAlthough the requirements of the HFCAA apply to securities of all foreign (non-U.S.) issuers, the SEC has thus far limited its enforcement efforts to securities of Chinese companies.\n\nIf securities are delisted, the Fund\u2019s ability to transact in such securities will be impaired, and the liquidity and market price of the securities may decline.\n\nThe Fund may also need to seek other markets in which to transact in such securities, which could increase the Fund\u2019s costs.\n\nIn connection with its investments in foreign securities, the Fund also may enter into contracts with banks, brokers or dealers to purchase or sell securities or foreign currencies at a future date.", "A foreign currency forward exchange contract is a negotiated agreement between the contracting parties to exchange a specified amount of currency at a specified future time at a specified rate.\n\nThe rate can be higher or lower than the spot rate between the currencies that are the subject of the contract.\n\nForeign currency forward exchange contracts may be used to seek to protect against uncertainty in the level of future foreign currency exchange rates or to gain or modify exposure to a particular currency.\n\nIn addition, the Fund may use cross currency hedging or proxy hedging with respect to currencies in which the Fund has or expects to have portfolio or currency exposure.\n\nCross currency and proxy hedges involve the sale of one currency against the positive exposure to a different currency and may be used for hedging purposes or to establish an active exposure to the exchange rate between any two currencies.", "To the extent hedged by the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts, the precise matching of the foreign currency forward exchange contract amounts and the value of the securities involved will not generally be possible because the future value of such securities in foreign currencies will change as a consequence of market movements in the value of those securities between the date on which the contract is entered into and the date it matures.\n\nFurthermore, such transactions may reduce or preclude the opportunity for gain if the value of the currency should move in the direction opposite to the position taken.\n\nThere is an additional risk to the extent that foreign currency forward exchange contracts create exposure to currencies in which the Fund\u2019s securities are not denominated.\n\nUnanticipated changes in currency prices may result in poorer overall performance for the Fund than if it had not entered into such contracts.", "The use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts involves the risk of loss from the insolvency or bankruptcy of the counterparty to the contract or the failure of the counterparty to make payments or otherwise comply with the terms of the contract.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus  |  Fund Details\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\nEmerging Market Securities\n\nThe Fund may invest in emerging market or developing countries, which are countries that major international financial institutions generally consider to be less economically mature than developed nations (such as the United States or most nations in Western Europe).\n\nEmerging market or developing countries may be more likely to experience political turmoil or rapid changes in economic conditions than more developed countries, and the financial condition of issuers in emerging market or developing countries may be more precarious than in other countries.", "Certain emerging market countries may be subject to less stringent requirements regarding accounting, auditing, financial reporting and record keeping and therefore, material information related to an investment may not be available or reliable.\n\nIn addition, the Fund is limited in its ability to exercise its legal rights or enforce a counterparty\u2019s legal obligations in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States, in particular, in emerging markets countries.\n\nIn addition, due to jurisdictional limitations, U.S. authorities (e.g., SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice) may be limited in their ability to enforce regulatory or legal obligations in emerging market countries.\n\nIn addition, emerging market securities generally are less liquid and subject to wider price and currency fluctuations than securities issued in more developed countries.", "These characteristics result in greater risk of price volatility in emerging market or developing countries, which may be heightened by currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\nFocused Investing\n\nAlthough the Fund is a diversified investment company under the 1940 Act, the Fund typically invests a significant portion of its portfolio in a limited number of issuers, which may be in the same industry, sector or geographic region.\n\nAs a result, the Fund will be more susceptible to risks associated with, and negative events, conditions or developments affecting or economic results of, those issuers, industries, sectors or geographic regions, and a decline in the value of a particular instrument may cause the Fund\u2019s overall value to be more volatile and decline to a greater degree than if the Fund were invested more widely.\n\nSuch volatility and decline may be sudden and significant.", "In addition, if such issuers are within the same market segment or of a similar type (e.g., growth stocks), the Fund will be more sensitive to adverse developments or conditions and risks affecting such market segment or type of issuer, including that the market segment or type of issuer may fall out of favor, than if the Fund were invested more widely.\n\nThe Fund does not lose its status as a diversified investment company because of any subsequent discrepancy between the value of its various investments and the diversification requirements of the 1940 Act, so long as any such discrepancy existing immediately after the Fund\u2019s acquisition of any security or other property is neither wholly nor partly the result of such acquisition.\n\nLiquidity", "The Fund may make investments that are illiquid or restricted or that may become illiquid or less liquid in response to, among other developments, overall economic conditions or adverse investor perceptions, and which may entail greater risk than investments in other types of securities.\n\nIlliquidity can also be caused by, among other things, a drop in overall market trading volume, an inability to find a willing buyer, or legal restrictions on the securities\u2019 resale.\n\nThese investments may be more difficult to value or sell, particularly in times of market turmoil, and there may be little trading in the secondary market available for particular securities.\n\nIf the Fund is forced to sell an illiquid or restricted security to fund redemptions or for other cash needs, it may be forced to sell the security at a loss or for less than its fair value and may be unable to sell the security at all.\n\nMarket and Geopolitical Risk", "The value of your investment in the Fund is based on the values of the Fund\u2019s investments, which change due to economic and other events that affect markets generally, as well as those that affect particular regions, countries, industries, companies or governments.\n\nPrice movements, sometimes called volatility, may be greater or less depending on the types of securities the Fund owns and the markets in which the securities trade.\n\nVolatility and disruption in financial markets and economies may be sudden and unexpected, expose the Fund to greater risk, including risks associated with reduced market liquidity and fair valuation, and adversely affect the Fund\u2019s operations.\n\nFor example, the Adviser potentially will be prevented from executing investment decisions at an advantageous time or price as a result of any domestic or global market disruptions and reduced market liquidity may impact the Fund\u2019s ability to sell securities to meet redemptions.", "The increasing interconnectivity between global economies and markets increases the likelihood that events or conditions in one region or market may adversely impact other companies and issuers in a different country, region, sector, industry, market or with respect to one company may adversely impact issuers in a different country, region, sector, industry, or market.\n\nFor example, adverse developments in the banking or financial services sector could impact companies operating in various sectors or industries and adversely impact the Fund\u2019s investments.\n\nSecurities in the Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform due to inflation (or expectations for inflation), interest rates, global demand for particular products or resources, natural disasters and extreme weather events, health emergencies (such as epidemics and pandemics), terrorism, regulatory events and governmental or quasi-governmental actions.", "The occurrence of global events, such as terrorist attacks around the world, natural disasters, health emergencies, social and political (including geopolitical) discord and tensions or debt crises and downgrades, among others, may result in market volatility and may have long term effects on both the U.S. and global financial markets.\n\nInflation rates may change frequently and significantly because of various factors, including unexpected shifts in the domestic or global economy and changes in monetary or economic policies (or expectations that these policies may change).\n\nChanges in expected inflation rates may adversely affect market and economic conditions, the Fund\u2019s investments and an investment in the Fund.\n\nThe market price of debt securities generally falls as inflation\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus | Fund Details\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)", "increases because the purchasing power of the future income and repaid principal is expected to be worth less when received by the Fund.\n\nThe risk of inflation is greater for debt instruments with longer maturities and especially those that pay a fixed rather than variable interest rate.\n\nOther financial, economic and other global market and social developments or disruptions may result in similar adverse circumstances, and it is difficult to predict when similar events affecting the U.S. or global financial markets may occur, the effects that such events may have and the duration of those effects (which may last for extended periods).\n\nIn general, the securities or other instruments that the Adviser believes represent an attractive investment opportunity or in which the Fund seeks to invest may be unavailable entirely or in the specific quantities sought by the Fund.", "As a result, the Fund may need to obtain the desired exposure through a less advantageous investment, forgo the investment at the time or seek to replicate the desired exposure through a derivative transaction or investment in another investment vehicle.\n\nAny such event(s) could have a significant adverse impact on the value and risk profile of the Fund\u2019s portfolio.\n\nThere is a risk that you may lose money by investing in the Fund.", "Social, political, economic and other conditions and events, such as war, natural disasters, health emergencies (e.g., epidemics and pandemics), terrorism, conflicts, social unrest, recessions, inflation, interest rate changes and supply chain disruptions could reduce consumer demand or economic output, result in market closures, travel restrictions or quarantines, and generally have a significant impact on the economies and financial markets and the Adviser\u2019s investment advisory activities and services of other service providers, which in turn could adversely affect the Fund\u2019s investments and other operations.\n\nGovernment and other public debt, including municipal obligations in which the Fund may invest, can be adversely affected by changes in local and global economic conditions that result in increased debt levels.", "Although high levels of government and other public debt do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, high levels of debt may create certain systemic risks if sound debt management practices are not implemented.\n\nA high debt level may increase market pressures to meet an issuer\u2019s funding needs, which may increase borrowing costs and cause a government or public or municipal entity to issue additional debt, thereby increasing the risk of refinancing.\n\nA high debt level also raises concerns that the issuer may be unable or unwilling to repay the principal or interest on its debt, which may adversely impact instruments held by the Fund that rely on such payments.\n\nGovernmental and quasi-governmental responses to certain economic or other conditions may lead to increasing government and other public debt, which heighten these risks.", "Unsustainable debt levels can lead to declines in the value of currency, and can prevent a government from implementing effective counter-cyclical fiscal policy during economic downturns, can generate or contribute to an economic downturn or cause other adverse economic or market developments, such as increases in inflation or volatility.\n\nIncreasing government and other public debt may adversely affect issuers, obligors, guarantors or instruments across a variety of asset classes.\n\nGlobal events may negatively impact broad segments of businesses and populations, cause a significant negative impact on the performance of the Fund\u2019s investments, adversely affect and increase the volatility of the Fund\u2019s share price, exacerbate pre-existing political, social and economic risks to the Fund.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s operations may be interrupted as a result, which may contribute to the negative impact on investment performance.", "In addition, governments, their regulatory agencies, or self-regulatory organizations may take actions that affect the instruments in which the Fund invests, or the issuers of such instruments, in ways that could have a significant negative impact on the Fund\u2019s investment performance.\n\nIn addition, government actions (such as changes to interest rates) could have unintended economic and market consequences that adversely affect the Fund\u2019s investments.\n\nPrivate Placements and Restricted Securities\n\nThe Fund\u2019s investments may include privately placed securities, which are subject to resale restrictions.\n\nThese securities could have the effect of increasing the level of Fund illiquidity to the extent the Fund may be unable to sell or transfer these securities due to restrictions on transfers or on the ability to find buyers interested in purchasing the securities.", "Additionally, the market for certain investments deemed liquid at the time of purchase may become illiquid under adverse market or economic conditions.\n\nThe illiquidity of the market, as well as the lack of publicly available information regarding these securities, may also adversely affect the ability to arrive at a fair value for certain securities at certain times and could make it difficult for the Fund to sell certain securities.\n\nIf the Fund is forced to sell an illiquid security to fund redemptions or for other cash needs, it may be forced to sell the security at a loss or for less than its fair value.\n\nInformation Technology Sector Risk", "To the extent the Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the information technology sector, the value of Fund shares may be particularly impacted by events that adversely affect the information technology sector, such as rapid changes in technology product cycles, competition for the services of qualified personnel and government regulation.\n\nThe products of information technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction and unpredictable changes in growth rates.\n\nCompanies in the information technology sector also can be heavily dependent on patent protection and the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.\n\nAs a result, the value of shares may fluctuate more than that of a fund that does not invest significantly in companies in the technology sector.\n\nOther Risks.", "The performance of the Fund also will depend on whether or not the Adviser is successful in applying the Fund\u2019s investment strategies.\n\nThe Fund is also subject to other risks from its permissible investments, including the risks associated with\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus  |  Fund Details\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\nits investments in fixed-income securities, REITs and foreign real estate companies, and derivatives.\n\nFor more information about these and other risks, see the \u201cAdditional Risk Information\u201d section below.\n\nAdditional Risk Information\n\nThis section provides additional information relating to the risks of investing in the Fund.\n\nFixed-Income Securities\n\nFixed-income securities are securities that pay a fixed or a variable rate of interest until a stated maturity date.", "Fixed-income securities include U.S. government securities, securities issued by federal or federally sponsored agencies and instrumentalities, corporate bonds and notes, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, securities rated below investment grade (commonly referred to as \u201cjunk bonds\u201d or \u201chigh yield/high risk securities\u201d), municipal bonds, loan participations and assignments, zero coupon bonds, convertible securities, Eurobonds, Brady Bonds, Yankee Bonds, repurchase agreements, commercial paper and cash equivalents.\n\nFixed-income securities are subject to the risk of the issuer\u2019s inability to meet principal and interest payments on its obligations (i.e., credit risk) and are subject to price volatility resulting from, among other things, interest rate sensitivity (i.e., interest rate risk), market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (i.e., market risk).", "For example, a type of fixed-income securities in which the Fund may invest are corporate debt obligations.\n\nIn addition to interest rate, credit and other risks, corporate debt obligations are also subject to factors directly related to the issuer, such as the credit rating of the corporation, the corporation\u2019s performance and perceptions of the corporation in the marketplace, and by factors not directly related to the issuer, such as general market liquidity, economic conditions and inflation.\n\nThe Fund may face a heightened level of interest rate risk in times of monetary policy change and/or uncertainty, such as when the Federal Reserve Board adjusts a quantitative easing program and/or changes rates.\n\nA changing interest rate environment increases certain risks, including the potential for periods of volatility, increased redemptions, shortened durations (i.e., prepayment risk) and extended durations (i.e., extension risk).", "Fixed income and other debt instruments, including mortgage- and other asset-backed securities, are subject to prepayment risk, which is the risk that the principal of such obligation is paid earlier than expected, such as in the case of refinancing.\n\nThis risk is increased during periods of declining interest rates and prepayments may reduce the Fund\u2019s yield or income as a result of reinvesting the income or other proceeds in lower yielding securities or instruments.\n\nThese investments are also subject to extension risk, which is the risk that the principal of such obligation is paid slower or later than expected.\n\nThis may negatively affect Fund returns, as the value of the investment decreases when principal payments are made later than expected.\n\nThis risk is elevated during periods of increasing interest rates.", "In addition, because principal payments are made later than expected, the investment\u2019s duration may extend (and result in increased interest rate risk) and the Fund may be prevented from investing proceeds it would otherwise have received at the higher prevailing interest rates.\n\nPrepayments and extensions may result in a security or debt instrument offering less potential for gains during periods of declining interest rates or rising interest rates, respectively.\n\nSecurities with longer durations are likely to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates, generally making them more volatile than securities with shorter durations.\n\nLower rated fixed-income securities have greater volatility because there is less certainty that principal and interest payments will be made as scheduled.\n\nA portion of the Fund\u2019s fixed-income securities may be rated below investment grade.", "The Fund may be subject to liquidity risk, which may result from the lack of an active market and the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in fixed-income securities.\n\nFixed-income securities may be called (i.e., redeemed by the issuer) prior to final maturity.\n\nIf a callable security is called, the Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds at a lower rate of interest.\n\nREITs and Foreign Real Estate Companies\n\nInvesting in REITs and foreign real estate companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly and investing in companies in the real estate industry, including the risks associated with residential and commercial real estate, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which REITs and foreign real estate companies are organized and operated.\n\nREITs and foreign real estate companies generally invest directly in real estate, in mortgages or in some combination of the two.", "Real estate income and values may also be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changing tastes, preferences (such as remote work arrangements) and values.\n\nOperating REITs and foreign real estate companies requires specialized management skills and the Fund indirectly bears management expenses along with the direct expenses of the Fund.\n\nThe value of REIT and foreign real estate company securities will also rise and fall in response to the management skill and creditworthiness of the issuer.\n\nIn particular, the value of these securities may decline when interest rates rise and will also be affected by the real estate market and by the management or development of the underlying properties, which may also be subject to mortgage loans and the underlying mortgage loans may be subject to the risks of default.", "REITs may be more volatile and/or more illiquid than other types of securities, and publicly traded REIT and real estate company shares are also subject to risks associated with equity securities.\n\nIn addition, individual REITs and foreign real estate companies may own a limited number of properties and may concentrate in a particular region or property type.\n\nREITs may also be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers or tenants and self-liquidation.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus | Fund Details\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\nREITs also must satisfy specific requirements of the Code in order to qualify for tax-free pass-through income.\n\nThe failure of a company to qualify as a REIT could have adverse consequences for the Fund, including significantly reducing the return to the Fund on its investment in such company.", "Foreign real estate companies may be subject to laws, rules and regulations governing those entities and their failure to comply with those laws, rules and regulations could negatively impact the performance of those entities.\n\nIn addition, REITs and foreign real estate companies, like mutual funds, have expenses, including management and administration fees, that are paid by their shareholders.\n\nAs a result, shareholders will directly bear the expenses of their investment in the Fund and indirectly bear the expenses of the Fund\u2019s investments when the Fund invests in REITs and foreign real estate companies.\n\nDerivatives\n\nThe Fund may, but is not required to, use derivatives and other similar instruments for a variety of purposes, including hedging, risk management, portfolio management or to seek to earn income.", "Derivative instruments used by the Fund will be counted towards the Fund\u2019s exposure in the types of securities listed herein to the extent they have economic characteristics similar to such securities.\n\nA derivative is a financial instrument whose value is based, in part, on the value of an underlying asset, interest rate, index or financial instrument.\n\nPrevailing interest rates and volatility levels, among other things, also affect the value of derivative instruments.", "Derivatives and other similar instruments that create synthetic exposure often are subject to risks similar to those of the underlying asset or instrument and may be subject to additional risks, including imperfect correlation between the value of the derivative and the underlying asset, risks of default by the counterparty to certain transactions, magnification of losses incurred due to changes in the market value of the securities, instruments, indices or interest rates to which the derivative instrument relates, risks that the transactions may not be liquid, risks arising from margin and payment requirements, risks arising from mispricing or valuation complexity and operational and legal risks.\n\nThe use of derivatives involves risks that are different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with other portfolio investments.", "Derivatives may involve the use of highly specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analyses different from those associated with other portfolio investments.\n\nCertain derivative transactions may give rise to a form of leverage.\n\nLeverage magnifies the potential for gain and the risk of loss.\n\nLeverage associated with derivative transactions may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so, or may cause the Fund to be more volatile than if the Fund had not been leveraged.\n\nAlthough the Adviser seeks to use derivatives to further the Fund\u2019s investment objective, there is no assurance that the use of derivatives will achieve this result.\n\nThe derivative instruments and techniques that the Fund may use include:\n\nFutures.\n\nA futures contract is a standardized, exchange-traded agreement to buy or sell a specific quantity of an underlying asset, reference rate or index at a specific price at a specific future time.", "While the value of a futures contract tends to increase or decrease in tandem with the value of the underlying instrument, differences between the futures market and the market for the underlying asset may result in an imperfect correlation.\n\nDepending on the terms of the particular contract, futures contracts are settled through either physical delivery of the underlying instrument on the settlement date or by payment of a cash settlement amount on the settlement date.\n\nA decision as to whether, when and how to use futures contracts involves the exercise of skill and judgment and even a well-conceived futures transaction may be unsuccessful because of market behavior or unexpected events.\n\nIn addition to the derivatives risks discussed above, the prices of futures contracts can be highly volatile, using futures contracts can lower total return, and the potential loss from futures contracts can exceed the Fund\u2019s initial investment in such contracts.", "No assurance can be given that a liquid market will exist for any particular futures contract at any particular time.\n\nThere is also the risk of loss by the Fund of margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker with which the Fund has open positions in the futures contract.\n\nOptions.\n\nIf the Fund buys an option, it buys a legal contract giving it the right to buy or sell a specific amount of the underlying instrument, foreign currency or contract, such as a swap agreement or futures contract, on the underlying instrument or foreign currency at an agreed-upon price typically in exchange for a premium paid by the Fund.\n\nIf the Fund sells an option, it sells to another person the right to buy from or sell to the Fund a specific amount of the underlying instrument, swap, foreign currency, or futures contract on the underlying instrument or foreign currency at an agreed-upon price during a period of time or on a specified date typically in exchange for a premium received by the Fund.", "When options are purchased OTC, the Fund bears the risk that the counterparty that wrote the option will be unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the option contract.\n\nOptions may also be illiquid and the Fund may have difficulty closing out its position.\n\nA decision as to whether, when and how to use options involves the exercise of skill and judgment and even a well-conceived option transaction may be unsuccessful because of market behavior or unexpected events.\n\nThe prices of options can be highly volatile and the use of options can lower total returns.\n\nInvestments in foreign currency options may substantially change the Fund\u2019s exposure to currency exchange rates and could result in losses to the Fund if currencies do not perform as the Adviser expects.\n\nThere is a risk that such transactions may reduce or preclude the opportunity for gain if the value of the currency should move in the direction opposite to the position taken.", "The value of a foreign currency option is dependent upon the value of the underlying foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar or other applicable foreign currency.\n\nThe price of the option may vary with changes in the value of either or both currencies and has no relationship to the investment merits of a foreign security.\n\nOptions on foreign currencies are affected by all of those factors that influence foreign exchange rates and foreign investment generally.\n\nUnanticipated changes in currency prices may result in losses to the Fund and\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus  |  Fund Details\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\npoorer overall performance for the Fund than if it had not entered into such contracts.\n\nOptions on foreign currencies are traded primarily in the OTC market, but may also be traded on U.S. and foreign exchanges.", "Foreign currency options contracts may be used for hedging purposes or non-hedging purposes in pursuing the Fund\u2019s investment objective, such as when the Adviser anticipates that particular non-U.S. currencies will appreciate or depreciate in value, even though securities denominated in those currencies are not then held in the Fund\u2019s investment portfolio.\n\nInvesting in foreign currencies for purposes of gaining from projected changes in exchange rates, as opposed to only hedging currency risks applicable to the Fund\u2019s holdings, further increases the Fund\u2019s exposure to foreign securities losses.\n\nThere is no assurance that the Adviser\u2019s use of currency derivatives will benefit the Fund or that they will be, or can be, used at appropriate times.\n\nSwaps.\n\nThe Fund may enter into OTC swap contracts or cleared swap transactions.", "An OTC swap contract is an agreement between two parties pursuant to which the parties exchange payments at specified dates on the basis of a specified notional amount, with the payments calculated by reference to specified securities, indices, reference rates, currencies or other instruments.\n\nTypically swap agreements provide that when the period payment dates for both parties are the same, the payments are made on a net basis (i.e., the two payment streams are netted out, with only the net amount paid by one party to the other).\n\nThe Fund\u2019s obligations or rights under a swap contract entered into on a net basis will generally be equal only to the net amount to be paid or received under the agreement, based on the relative values of the positions held by each party.\n\nCleared swap transactions may help reduce counterparty credit risk.\n\nIn a cleared swap, the Fund\u2019s ultimate counterparty is a clearinghouse rather than a swap dealer, bank or other financial institution.", "OTC swap agreements are not entered into or traded on exchanges and often there is no central clearing or guaranty function for swaps.\n\nThese OTC swaps are often subject to credit risk or the risk of default or non-performance by the counterparty.\n\nCertain swaps have begun trading on exchanges called swap execution facilities.\n\nExchange trading is expected to increase liquidity of swaps trading.\n\nBoth OTC and cleared swaps could result in losses if interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or other factors are not correctly anticipated by the Fund or if the reference index, security or investments do not perform as expected.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and related regulatory developments require the clearing and exchange trading of certain standardized swap transactions.\n\nMandatory exchange-trading and clearing is occurring on a phased-in basis.\n\nThe Fund may pay fees or incur costs each time it enters into, amends or terminates a swap agreement.", "Structured Investments.\n\nThe Fund also may invest a portion of its assets in structured investments.\n\nA structured investment is a derivative security designed to offer a return linked to a particular underlying security, currency, commodity or market.\n\nStructured investments may come in various forms including notes (such as exchange-traded notes), warrants and options to purchase securities.\n\nThe Fund will typically use structured investments to gain exposure to a permitted underlying security, currency, commodity or market when direct access to a market is limited or inefficient from a tax or cost standpoint.\n\nThere can be no assurance that structured investments will trade at the same price or have the same value as the underlying security, currency, commodity or market.\n\nInvestments in structured investments involve risks including issuer risk, counterparty risk and market risk.", "Holders of structured investments bear risks of the underlying investment and are subject to issuer or counterparty risk because the Fund is relying on the creditworthiness of such issuer or counterparty and has no rights with respect to the underlying investment.\n\nCertain structured investments may be thinly traded or have a limited trading market and may have the effect of increasing the Fund\u2019s illiquidity to the extent that the Fund, at a particular point in time, may be unable to find qualified buyers for these securities.\n\nESG Investment Risk\n\nTo the extent that the Adviser considers environmental, social and/or governance (\u201cESG\u201d) issues as a component in its investment decision-making process, the Fund\u2019s performance may be impacted.", "Additionally, the Adviser\u2019s consideration of ESG issues in its investment decision-making process may require subjective analysis and the ability of the Adviser to consider ESG issues may be difficult if data about a particular issuer (or obligor) is limited.\n\nThe Adviser\u2019s consideration of ESG issues may contribute to the Adviser\u2019s decision to forgo opportunities to buy certain securities.\n\nESG issues with respect to an issuer (or obligor) or the Adviser\u2019s assessment of such may change over time.\n\nSpecial Purpose Acquisition Companies\n\nA special purpose acquisition company (\u201cSPAC\u201d) is a publicly traded company that raises investment capital for the purpose of acquiring or merging with an existing company.\n\nTypically, the acquisition target is an existing privately held company that wants to trade publicly, which it accomplishes through a combination with a SPAC rather than by conducting a traditional initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d).", "SPACs and similar entities are blank check companies and do not have any operating history or ongoing business other than seeking acquisitions.\n\nThe long term value of a SPAC\u2019s securities is particularly dependent on the ability of the SPAC\u2019s management to identify a merger target and complete an acquisition.\n\nAn investment in a SPAC is subject to the risks that any proposed acquisition or merger may not obtain the requisite approval of SPAC shareholders, may require governmental or other approvals that it fails to obtain or that an acquisition or merger, once effected, may prove unsuccessful and lose value.\n\nIn addition, among other conflicts of interest, the economic interests of the management, directors, officers and related parties of a SPAC can differ from the economic interests of public shareholders, which may lead to conflicts as they evaluate, negotiate and recommend business combination transactions to shareholders.\n\nThis risk may\n\nBack to Table of Contents", "Morgan Stanley Prospectus | Fund Details\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\nbecome more acute as the deadline for the completion of a business combination nears or in the event that attractive acquisition or merger targets become scarce.\n\nAn investment in a SPAC is also subject to the risk that a significant portion of the funds raised by the SPAC may be expended during the search for a target acquisition or merger.\n\nThe value of investments in SPACs may be highly volatile and may depreciate over time.\n\nIn addition, investments in SPACs may be subject to the same risks as investing in any initial public offering, including the risks associated with companies that have little operating history as public companies, including unseasoned trading, small number of shares available for trading and limited information about the issuer.\n\nIn addition, the market for IPO issuers may be volatile, and share prices of newly-public companies have fluctuated significantly over short periods of time.", "Although some IPOs may produce high returns, such returns are not typical and may not be sustainable.\n\nCertain investments in SPACs are privately placed securities and are also subject to the risks of such securities.\n\nLarge Shareholder Transactions Risk\n\nThe Fund may experience adverse effects when certain shareholders, or shareholders collectively, purchase or redeem large amounts of shares of the Fund.\n\nSuch larger than normal redemptions may cause the Fund to sell portfolio securities at times when it would not otherwise do so, which may negatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV and liquidity.\n\nSimilarly, large Fund share purchases may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s performance to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain a larger cash position than it ordinarily would.\n\nThese transactions may also accelerate the realization of taxable income to shareholders if such sales of investments resulted in gains, and may also increase transaction costs.", "In addition, a large redemption could result in the Fund\u2019s current expenses being allocated over a smaller asset base, leading to an increase in the Fund\u2019s expense ratio.\n\nAlthough large shareholder transactions may be more frequent under certain circumstances, the Fund is generally subject to the risk that shareholders can purchase or redeem a significant percentage of Fund shares at any time.\n\nActive Management Risk\n\nIn pursuing the Fund\u2019s investment objective, the Adviser has considerable leeway in deciding which investments it buys, holds or sells on a day-to-day basis, and which trading strategies it uses.\n\nFor example, the Adviser, in its discretion, may determine to use some permitted trading strategies while not using others.\n\nThe success or failure of such decisions will affect the Fund\u2019s performance.\n\nIn addition, it is expected that confidential or material non-public information regarding an investment or potential investment opportunity may become available to the Adviser.", "If such information becomes available, the Adviser may be precluded (including by applicable law or internal policies or procedures) from pursuing an investment or disposition opportunity with respect to such investment or investment opportunity and the Adviser may be restricted in its ability to cause the Fund to buy or sell securities of an issuer for substantial periods of time when the Fund otherwise could realize profit or avoid loss.\n\nThis may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s flexibility with respect to buying or selling securities and may impair the Fund\u2019s liquidity.\n\nRegulatory and Legal Risk\n\nU.S. and non-U.S. governmental agencies and other regulators regularly implement additional regulations and legislators pass new laws that affect the investments held by the Fund, the strategies used by the Fund or the level of regulation or taxation applying to the Fund (such as regulations related to investments in derivatives and other transactions).", "These regulations and laws impact the investment strategies, performance, costs and operations of the Fund or taxation of shareholders.\n\nThe SEC has recently proposed amendments to Rule 22e-4 of the 1940 Act that, if adopted, would result in changes to the Fund\u2019s liquidity classification framework and could potentially increase the percentage of the Fund\u2019s investments classified as illiquid.\n\nIn addition, the Fund\u2019s operations and investment strategies may be adversely impacted if the proposed amendments are adopted.\n\nPortfolio Holdings\n\nA description of the Fund\u2019s policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities is available in the Fund\u2019s SAI.\n\nFund Management\n\nThe Fund has retained the Adviser\u2014Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc.\u2014to provide investment advisory services.", "The Adviser is a

of fee waivers, if applicable) amounting to 0.65% of the Fund\u2019s average daily net assets.\n\nMorgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., as the Adviser and the Administrator, has agreed to reduce its advisory fee, its administration fee and/or reimburse the Fund, if necessary, if such fees would cause the total annual operating expenses of the Fund to exceed 1.27% for Class A, 1.77% for Class L, 0.92% for Class I, 2.02% for Class C and 0.85% for Class R6.", "In determining the actual amount of fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement for the Fund, if any, the Adviser and the Administrator exclude from total annual operating expenses, acquired fund fees and expenses (as applicable), certain investment related expenses, taxes, interest and other extraordinary expenses (including litigation).\n\nThe fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of this Prospectus or until such time as the Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees acts to

Shares\n\nThe NAV of the Fund (excluding sales charges) is based on the value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities.\n\nWhile the assets of each class are invested in a single portfolio of securities, the NAV of each class will differ because the classes have different ongoing fees.\n\nThe NAV of the Fund is determined once daily on each business day as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) or such other times as the NYSE may officially close (the \u201cPricing Time\u201d).", "Shares generally will not be priced on days that the NYSE is closed.\n\nIf the NYSE is closed due to inclement weather, technology problems or any other reason on a day it would normally be open for business, or the NYSE has an unscheduled early closing on a day it has opened for business, the Fund reserves the right to treat such day as a business day and accept purchase and redemption orders until, and calculate its NAV as of, the normally scheduled close of regular trading on the NYSE for that day, so long as the Adviser believes there generally remains an adequate market to obtain reliable and accurate market quotations.\n\nThe Fund may elect to remain open and price its shares on days when the NYSE is closed but the primary securities markets on which the Fund\u2019s securities trade remain open.\n\nTrading of securities, which are traded on exchanges other than the NYSE, may take place on days when a Fund does not price its shares.", "Therefore, to the extent, if any, that a Fund invests in securities traded on other exchanges, the value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities may change on days when you will not be able to purchase or sell your shares.\n\nThe Fund relies on various sources to calculate its NAV.\n\nThe ability of the Fund\u2019s provider of administrative services to calculate the NAV per share of the Fund is subject to operational risks associated with processing or human errors, systems or technology failures, cyber attacks and errors caused by third party service providers, data sources, or trading counterparties.\n\nSuch failures may result in delays in the calculation of the Fund\u2019s NAV and/or the inability to calculate NAV over extended time periods.\n\nThe Fund may be unable to recover any losses associated with such failures.", "In addition, if the third party service providers and/or data sources upon which the Fund directly or indirectly relies to calculate its NAV or price individual securities are unavailable or otherwise unable to calculate the NAV correctly, it may be necessary for alternative procedures to be utilized to price the securities at the time of determining the Fund\u2019s NAV.\n\nThe value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities is based on the securities\u2019 market price when available.\n\nWhen no market quotations are readily available for a security or other asset, including circumstances under which the Adviser determines that a market quotation is not accurate, fair value for the security or other asset will be determined in good faith using methods approved by the Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees.", "In addition, with respect to securities that primarily are listed on foreign exchanges, when an event occurs after the close of such exchanges that is likely to have changed the value of the securities (e.g., a percentage change in value of one or more U.S. securities indices in excess of specified thresholds), such securities will be valued at their fair value, as determined in good faith using methods approved by the Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees.\n\nSecurities also may be fair valued in the event of a significant development affecting a country or region or an issuer-specific development that is likely to have changed the value of the security.\n\nIn these cases, the Fund\u2019s NAV will reflect certain portfolio securities\u2019 fair value rather than their market price.\n\nFair value pricing involves subjective judgments and it is possible that the fair value determined for a security or other asset is materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of that security or asset.", "To the extent the Fund invests in open-end management companies (other than exchange-traded funds) that are registered under the 1940 Act, the Fund\u2019s NAV is calculated based in relevant part upon the NAV of such funds.\n\nThe prospectuses for such funds explain the circumstances under which they will use their fair value pricing and its effects.\n\nContacting a Morgan Stanley

and other features applicable to such shares.\n\nConversion to another class of shares will result in holding a share class with higher fees.\n\nThe Fund will not convert to another class of shares based solely upon changes in the market that reduce the NAV of shares.\n\nUnder current tax law, conversion between share classes is not a taxable event to the shareholder.\n\nShareholders will be notified prior to any such conversion.", "Reinstatement Privilege.\n\nIf you redeem shares, you may reinvest at net asset value all or any portion of the redemption proceeds in the same account and in

used more than once in the prior 12 months, the redeemed shares were subject to a front-end sales charge or CDSC and that you are otherwise eligible to invest in that class.\n\nUnder these

|  Shareholder Information\n\nShareholder Information (Con\u2019t)\n\nThe Fund declares income dividends separately for each class.\n\nNormally, income dividends are declared and distributed to shareholders annually.\n\nCapital gains, if any, are usually distributed in December.\n\nThe Fund, however, may retain and reinvest any long-term capital gains.\n\nThe Fund may at times make payments from sources other than income or capital gains that represent a return of a portion of your investment.\n\nThese payments would not be taxable to you as a shareholder, but would have the effect of reducing your basis in the Fund.", "Distributions are reinvested automatically in additional shares of the same class and automatically credited to your account, unless you request in writing that all distributions be paid in cash.\n\nIf you elect the cash option, the Fund will mail a check to you no later than seven business days after the distribution is declared.\n\nHowever, if you purchase Fund shares through a Financial Intermediary within three business days prior to the record date for the distribution, the distribution will automatically be paid to you in cash, even if you did not request to receive all distributions in cash.\n\nNo interest will accrue on uncashed checks.\n\nIf you wish to change how your distributions are paid, your request should be received by the Transfer Agent at least five business days prior to the record date of the distributions.", "If any distribution check remains uncashed for six months, Morgan Stanley reserves the right to invest the amount represented by the check in Fund shares at the then-current net asset value of the Fund and all future distributions will be reinvested.\n\nFor accounts held directly with the Transfer Agent for which the shareholder has elected to receive distributions via check, any distribution (dividend or capital gain) under $10.00 is automatically reinvested in additional shares regardless of your elected distribution option.\n\nFrequent Purchases and Redemptions of Fund Shares", "Frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares by Fund shareholders are referred to as \u201cmarket-timing\u201d or \u201cshort-term trading\u201d and may present risks for other shareholders of the Fund, which may include, among other things, dilution in the value of Fund shares held by long-term shareholders, interference with the efficient management of the Fund\u2019s portfolio, increased brokerage and administrative costs, incurring unwanted taxable gains and forcing the Fund to hold excess levels of cash.\n\nIn addition, the Fund is subject to the risk that market-timers and/or short-term traders may take advantage of time zone differences between the foreign markets on which the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities trade and the time the Fund\u2019s NAV is calculated (\u201ctime-zone arbitrage\u201d).", "For example, a market-timer may purchase shares of the Fund based on events occurring after foreign market closing prices are established, but before the Fund\u2019s NAV calculation, that are likely to result in higher prices in foreign markets the following day.\n\nThe market-timer would redeem the Fund\u2019s shares the next day, when the Fund\u2019s share price would reflect the increased prices in foreign markets, for a quick profit at the expense of long-term Fund shareholders.\n\nInvestments in other types of securities also may be susceptible to short-term trading strategies.\n\nThese investments include securities that are, among other things, thinly traded, traded infrequently or relatively illiquid, which have the risk that the current market price for the securities may not accurately reflect current market values.\n\nA shareholder may seek to engage in short-term trading to take advantage of these pricing differences (referred to as \u201cprice arbitrage\u201d).", "Investments in certain fixed-income securities may be adversely affected by price arbitrage trading strategies.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s policies with respect to valuing portfolio securities are described in \u201cShareholder Information\u2014Pricing Fund Shares.\u201d\n\nThe Fund discourages and does not accommodate frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares by Fund shareholders and the Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees has adopted policies and procedures with respect to such frequent purchases and redemptions.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s policies with respect to purchases, redemptions and exchanges of Fund shares are described in the \u201cShareholder Information\u2014How to

trades that occur through omnibus accounts at Financial Intermediaries, as described below, the Fund\u2019s policies regarding frequent trading of Fund shares are applied uniformly to all shareholders.", "With respect to trades that occur through omnibus accounts at Financial Intermediaries, such as investment managers, broker-dealers, transfer agents and third-party administrators, the Fund (i) requests assurance that such Financial Intermediaries currently selling Fund shares have in place internal policies and procedures reasonably designed to address market-timing concerns and has instructed such Financial Intermediaries to notify the Fund immediately if they are unable to comply with such policies and procedures, and (ii) requires all prospective intermediaries to agree to cooperate in enforcing the Fund\u2019s policies (or, upon prior written approval only, a Financial Intermediary\u2019s own policies) with respect to frequent purchases, redemptions and exchanges of Fund shares.\n\nOmnibus accounts generally do not identify customers\u2019 trading activity to the Fund on an individual ongoing basis.", "Therefore, with respect to trades that occur through omnibus accounts at Financial Intermediaries, to some extent, the Fund relies on the Financial Intermediary to monitor frequent short-term trading within the Fund by the Financial Intermediary\u2019s customers.\n\nHowever, the Fund or the Distributor has entered into agreements with Financial Intermediaries whereby Financial Intermediaries are required to provide certain customer identification and transaction information upon the Fund\u2019s request.\n\nThe Fund may use this information to help identify and prevent market-timing activity in the Fund.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to identify or prevent all market-timing activities.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus | Shareholder Information\n\nShareholder

to be transferred to the relevant state (also known as \u201cescheatment\u201d) under various circumstances.\n\nThese circumstances, which vary by state, can include inactivity (e.g., no owner-initiated contact for a certain period), returned mail (e.g., when mail sent to a shareholder is returned by the post office as undeliverable), uncashed checks or a combination of these.\n\nAn incorrect address may cause a shareholder\u2019s account statements and other mailings to be returned to the Fund or your Financial Intermediary.\n\nSince states\u2019 statutory requirements regarding inactivity differ, it is important to regularly contact your Financial Intermediary or the Fund\u2019s transfer agent.\n\nThe process described above, and the application of state escheatment laws, may vary by state and/or depending on how shareholders hold their shares in the Fund.", "It is your responsibility to ensure that you maintain a valid mailing address for your account, keep your

to state and local income tax.\n\nAny income dividend distributions and any short-term capital gain distributions are taxable to you as ordinary income.\n\nAny long-term capital gain distributions are taxable as long-term capital gains, no matter how long you have owned shares in the Fund.\n\nIf certain holding period requirements are met with respect to your shares, a portion of the income dividends you receive may be taxed at the same rate as long-term capital gains.\n\nHowever, even if income received in the form of income dividends is taxed at the same rates as long-term capital gains, such income will not be considered long-term capital gains for other federal income tax purposes.", "For example, you generally will not be permitted to offset income dividends with capital losses.\n\nShort-term capital gain distributions are taxed at ordinary income rates.\n\nThe Fund does not anticipate that a significant percentage of its distributions will be eligible for the reduced rate of taxation applicable to qualified dividend income.\n\nIf certain holding period requirements are met, corporate shareholders may be entitled to a dividends-received deduction for the portion of dividends they receive which are attributable to dividends received by the Fund from U.S. corporations.\n\nThe Fund does not anticipate that a significant percentage of its distributions will be eligible for the dividends-received deduction.\n\nIf you buy shares of the Fund before a distribution, you will be subject to tax on the entire amount of the taxable distribution you receive.", "Distributions are taxable to you even if they are paid from income or gain earned by the Fund before your investment (and thus were included in the price you paid for your Fund shares).\n\nYou will be sent a statement (U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d)\n\nForm 1099-DIV) by February of each year showing the taxable distributions paid to you in the previous year.\n\nThe statement provides information on your dividends and any capital gains for tax purposes.\n\nYour sale of Fund shares normally is subject to federal and state income tax and may result in a taxable gain or loss to you.\n\nA sale also may be subject to local income tax.\n\nYour exchange of Fund shares for shares of another Morgan Stanley Fund is treated for tax purposes like a sale of your original shares and a purchase of your new shares.\n\nThus, the exchange may, like a sale, result in a taxable gain or loss to you and will give you a new tax basis for your new shares.", "An additional 3.8% Medicare tax

cost, FIFO (\u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d) or some other specific identification method.\n\nUnless you instruct otherwise, the Fund will use average cost as its default cost basis method, and will treat sales as first coming from shares purchased prior to January 1, 2012.\n\nIf average cost is used for the first sale of Fund shares covered by these new rules, the shareholder may only use an alternative cost basis method for shares purchased prospectively.", "Fund shareholders should consult with their tax advisors to determine the best cost basis method for their tax situation.\n\nWhen

"Morgan Stanley Insight Fund (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks long-term capital appreciation.\n\nFees and Expenses\n\nThe table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy, hold and sell Class IR shares of the Fund.\n\nThe Fund does not charge any sales load or other fees when you purchase or redeem Class IR shares.\n\nYou may pay fees other than the fees and expenses of the Fund, such as brokerage commissions and other fees charged by financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the tables and examples below.\n\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\n\n|  Class IR\n\nAdvisory Fee1 |  0.65%\n\nDistribution and/or Shareholder Service (12b-1)\n\nFee |  \n\nNone\n\nOther Expenses2 |

 0.85%\n\nExample", "The example below is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds.\n\nThe example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund, your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund\u2019s operating expenses remain the same (except that the example incorporates the fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement arrangement for only the first year).\n\nAlthough your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\n\nIf You SOLD Your Shares |\n\n|  1 Year |  3

\u201cSubsidiary\u201d).", "The Fund\u2019s \u201cAdviser,\u201d Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., has agreed to waive or credit a portion of the advisory fee in an amount equal to the management fee paid to the Adviser by the Subsidiary.\n\n2 | \u201cOther Expenses\u201d include expenses of the Fund\u2019s and Subsidiary\u2019s most recent fiscal year.\n\n3 | The Fund\u2019s \u201cAdviser\u201d and \u201cAdministrator,\u201d Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., has agreed to reduce its advisory fee, its administration fee and/or reimburse the Fund so that Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses, excluding acquired fund fees and expenses (as applicable), certain investment related expenses, taxes, interest and other extraordinary expenses (including litigation), will not exceed 0.85% for Class IR.", "The fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of this Prospectus or until such time as the Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements when it deems such action is appropriate.\n\nPortfolio Turnover\n\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \u201cturns over\u201d its portfolio).\n\nA higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account.\n\nThese costs, which are not reflected in Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the example, affect the Fund\u2019s performance.\n\nDuring the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 40% of the average value of its portfolio.\n\nPrincipal Investment Strategies", "Under normal circumstances, the Fund\u2019s assets will be invested primarily in a portfolio of common stocks of companies with market capitalizations, at the time of purchase, within the capitalization range of the companies comprising the Russell 3000\u00ae Growth Index, which as of December 31, 2023 was between $19.7 million and $3.0 trillion.\n\nThe Adviser seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in established and emerging companies.\n\nThe Adviser emphasizes a bottom-up stock selection process, seeking attractive investments on an individual company basis.\n\nIn selecting securities for investment, the Adviser typically invests in unique companies it believes have sustainable competitive advantages with above average business visibility, the ability to deploy capital at high rates of return, strong balance sheets and an attractive risk/reward.\n\nThe Fund may invest in other types of equity securities.", "The Fund may, but it is not required to, use derivative instruments as discussed herein.\n\nThese derivative instruments will be counted\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus | Fund Summary\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\ntoward the Fund\u2019s exposure in the types of securities listed herein to the extent they have economic characteristics similar to such securities.\n\nThe Adviser typically focuses a significant portion of the Fund\u2019s investments in a limited number of issuers, which may be in the same industry, sector or geographic region.\n\nThe Adviser actively integrates sustainability into the investment process by using environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) factors as a lens for additional fundamental research, which can contribute to investment decision-making.", "The Adviser seeks to understand how environmental and social initiatives within companies can create value by strengthening durable competitive advantages, creating growth opportunities, driving profitability and/or aligning with secular growth trends.\n\nThe Adviser generally engages with company management teams to discuss their ESG practices, with the aim of identifying how sustainability themes present opportunities and risks that can be material to the value of the security over the long-term.\n\nOther aspects of the investment process include a proprietary, systematic evaluation of governance policies, specifically focusing on compensation alignment on long-term value creation.\n\nAlthough consideration of ESG factors is incorporated into the investment process, it is only one of many tools the Adviser utilizes to make investment decisions.", "The Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in foreign securities, including emerging market securities and securities classified as American Depositary Receipts (\u201cADRs\u201d), Global Depositary Receipts (\u201cGDRs\u201d), American Depositary Shares (\u201cADSs\u201d) or Global Depositary Shares (\u201cGDSs\u201d), foreign U.S. dollar-denominated securities that are traded on a U.S. exchange or local shares of non-U.S. issuers.\n\nThe Fund may invest in privately placed and restricted securities.\n\nPrincipal Risks\n\nThere is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective, and you can lose money investing in this Fund.\n\nThe principal risks of investing in the Fund include:\n\n\u2022 |  Equity Securities.\n\nIn general, prices of equity securities are more volatile than those of fixed-income securities.", "The prices of equity securities fluctuate, and sometimes widely fluctuate, in response to activities specific to the issuer of the security as well as factors unrelated to the fundamental condition of the issuer, including general market, economic, political conditions and public health conditions.\n\nDuring periods when equity securities experience heightened volatility, such as during periods of market, economic or financial uncertainty or distress, the Fund\u2019s investments in equity securities may be subject to heightened risks.\n\n|  The value of equity securities and related instruments may decline in response to adverse changes in the economy or the economic outlook; deterioration in investor sentiment; interest rate, currency, and commodity price fluctuations; adverse geopolitical, social or environmental developments; issuer- and sector-specific considerations; unexpected trading activity among retail investors; and other factors.", "Market conditions may affect certain types of stocks to a greater extent than other types of stocks.\n\nIf the stock market declines, the value of Fund shares will also likely decline.\n\n\u2022 |  Small and Mid Cap Companies.\n\nInvestments in small and mid cap companies may involve greater risks than investments in larger, more established companies.\n\nThe securities issued by small and mid cap companies may be less liquid and such companies may have more limited markets, financial resources and product lines, and may lack the depth of management of larger companies.\n\n\u2022 |  Foreign and Emerging Market Securities.\n\nInvestments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political (including geopolitical), economic and market risks.", "There also may be greater market volatility, less reliable financial information, less stringent investor protections and disclosure standards, higher transaction and custody costs, decreased market liquidity and less government and exchange regulation associated with investments in foreign markets.\n\nIn addition, investments in certain foreign markets that have historically been considered stable may become more volatile and subject to increased risk due to developments and changing conditions in such markets.\n\nMoreover, the growing interconnectivity of global economies and financial markets has increased the probability that adverse developments and conditions in one country or region will affect the stability of economies and financial markets in other countries or regions.", "Certain foreign markets may rely heavily on particular industries or foreign capital and are more vulnerable to diplomatic developments, the imposition of economic sanctions against a particular country or countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals, changes in international trading patterns, trade barriers and other protectionist or retaliatory measures.\n\nInvestments in foreign markets may also be adversely affected by governmental actions such as the imposition of capital controls, nationalization of companies or industries, expropriation of assets or the imposition of punitive taxes.\n\nThe governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investing in their capital markets or in certain sectors or industries.", "In addition, a foreign government may limit or cause delay in the convertibility or repatriation of its currency which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value and/or liquidity of investments denominated in that currency.\n\nCertain foreign investments may become less liquid in response to market developments or adverse investor perceptions, or become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil.\n\nWhen the Fund holds illiquid investments, its portfolio may be harder to value.\n\nThe risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries.\n\nCertain emerging market countries may be subject to less stringent requirements regarding accounting, auditing, financial reporting and record keeping and therefore, material information related to an investment may not be available or reliable.", "In addition, the Fund is limited in its ability to exercise its legal rights or enforce a counterparty\u2019s legal obligations in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States, in particular, in emerging market\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus  |  Fund Summary\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\n|  countries.\n\nIn addition, the Fund\u2019s investments in foreign issuers may be denominated in foreign currencies and therefore, to the extent unhedged, the value of those investments will fluctuate with U.S. dollar exchange rates.\n\nTo the extent hedged by the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts, the precise matching of the foreign currency forward exchange contract amounts and the value of the securities involved will not generally be possible because the future value of such securities in foreign currencies will change as a consequence of market movements in the value of those securities between the date on which the contract is entered into and the date it matures.", "There is additional risk that such transactions may reduce or preclude the opportunity for gain if the value of the currency should move in the direction opposite to the position taken and that foreign currency forward exchange contracts create exposure to currencies in which the Fund\u2019s securities are not denominated.\n\nThe use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts involves the risk of loss from the insolvency or bankruptcy of the counterparty to the contract or the failure of the counterparty to make payments or otherwise comply with the terms of the contract.\n\nEconomic sanctions or other similar measures may be, and have been, imposed against certain countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals.", "Economic sanctions and other similar measures could, among other things, effectively restrict or eliminate the Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or sell securities, negatively impact the value or liquidity of the Fund\u2019s investments, significantly delay or prevent the settlement of the Fund\u2019s securities transactions, force the Fund to sell or otherwise dispose of investments at inopportune times or prices, or impair the Fund\u2019s ability to meet its investment objective or invest in accordance with its investment strategies.\n\n\u2022 |  Liquidity.\n\nThe Fund may make investments that are illiquid or restricted or that may become illiquid or less liquid in response to overall economic conditions or adverse investor perceptions, and which may entail greater risk than investments in other types of securities.\n\nThese investments may be more difficult to value or sell, particularly in times of market turmoil, and there may be little trading in the secondary market available for particular securities.", "If the Fund is forced to sell an illiquid or restricted security to fund redemptions or for other cash needs, it may be forced to sell the security at a loss or for less than its fair value and may be unable to sell the security at all.\n\n\u2022 |  Focused Investing.\n\nAlthough the Fund is a diversified investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), the Fund typically invests a significant portion of its portfolio in a limited number of issuers, which may be in the same industry, sector or geographic region.\n\nAs a result, the Fund will be more susceptible to risks associated with, and negative events affecting those issuers, industries, sectors or geographic regions, and a decline in the value of a particular instrument may cause the Fund\u2019s overall value to be more volatile and decline to a greater degree than if the Fund were invested more widely.\n\n\u2022 |  Private Placements and Restricted Securities.", "The Fund\u2019s investments may include privately placed securities, which are subject to resale restrictions.\n\nThese securities could have the effect of increasing the level of Fund illiquidity to the extent the Fund may be unable to sell or transfer these securities due to restrictions on transfers or on the ability to find buyers interested in purchasing the securities.\n\nAdditionally, the market for certain investments deemed liquid at the time of purchase may become illiquid under adverse market or economic conditions.\n\n\u2022 |  Information Technology Sector Risk.", "To the extent the Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the information technology sector, the value of Fund shares may be particularly impacted by events that adversely affect the information technology sector, such as rapid changes in technology product cycles, product obsolescence, government regulation, and competition, and may fluctuate more than that of a fund that does not invest significantly in companies in the technology sector.\n\n\u2022 |  Market and Geopolitical Risk.\n\nThe value of your investment in the Fund is based on the values of the Fund\u2019s investments, which change due to economic and other events that affect markets generally, as well as those that affect particular regions, countries, industries, companies or governments.\n\nThese events may be sudden and unexpected, and could adversely affect the liquidity of the Fund\u2019s investments, which may in turn impact valuation, the Fund\u2019s ability to sell securities and/or its ability to meet redemptions.", "The risks associated with these developments may be magnified if certain social, political, economic and other conditions and events (such as war, natural disasters, epidemics and pandemics, terrorism, conflicts, social unrest, recessions, inflation, interest rate changes and supply chain disruptions) adversely interrupt the global economy and financial markets.\n\nIt is difficult to predict when events affecting the U.S. or global financial markets may occur, the effects that such events may have and the duration of those effects (which may last for extended periods).\n\nThese events may negatively impact broad segments of businesses and populations and have a significant and rapid negative impact on the performance of the Fund\u2019s investments, adversely affect and increase the volatility of the Fund\u2019s share price and exacerbate pre-existing risks to the Fund.\n\n\u2022 |  Active Management Risk.", "In pursuing the Fund\u2019s investment objective, the Adviser has considerable leeway in deciding which investments to buy, hold or sell on a day-to-day basis, and which trading strategies to use.\n\nFor example, the Adviser, in its discretion, may determine to use some permitted trading strategies while not using others.\n\nThe success or failure of such decisions will affect the Fund\u2019s performance.\n\nShares of the Fund are not bank deposits and are not guaranteed or insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus |

IR Shares\u2019 performance from year-to-year and by showing how the Fund\u2019s average annual returns for the one year period and since inception compare with those of one or more indexes intended to measure broad market performance.", "The Fund\u2019s primary benchmark index was changed from the Russell 3000\u00ae Growth Index to the Russell 3000\u00ae Index effective April 30, 2024 to comply with the regulation that requires the Fund\u2019s primary benchmark to represent the overall applicable market.\n\nThe additional index in the table provides a means to compare the Fund\u2019s average

income.\n\nAdditional Information about Fund Investment Objective, Strategies and Related Risks\n\nInvestment Objective\n\nMorgan Stanley Insight Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation.\n\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the Fund\u2019s assets will be invested primarily in a portfolio of common stocks of companies with market capitalizations, at the time of purchase, within the capitalization range of the companies comprising the Russell 3000\u00ae Growth Index, which as of December 31, 2023 was between $19.7 million and $3.0 trillion.\n\nThe Adviser seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in established and emerging companies.\n\nThe Adviser emphasizes a bottom-up stock selection process, seeking attractive investments on an individual company basis.", "In selecting securities for investment, the Adviser typically invests in unique companies it believes have sustainable competitive advantages with above average business visibility, the ability to deploy capital at high rates of return, strong balance sheets and an attractive risk/reward.\n\nThe Fund may invest in other types of equity securities.\n\nThe Fund may, but it is not required to, use derivative instruments as discussed herein.\n\nThese derivative instruments will be counted toward the Fund\u2019s exposure in the types of securities listed herein to the extent they have economic characteristics similar to such securities.\n\nThe Adviser typically focuses a significant portion of the Fund\u2019s investments in a limited number of issuers, which may be in the same industry, sector or geographic region.\n\nThe Adviser generally considers selling an investment when it determines the company no longer satisfies its investment criteria.", "The Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in foreign securities, including emerging market securities and securities classified as ADRs, GDRs, ADSs or GDSs, foreign U.S. dollar-denominated securities that are traded on a U.S. exchange or local shares of non-U.S. issuers.\n\nThe Fund may invest in privately placed and restricted securities.\n\nThe Adviser actively integrates sustainability into the investment process by using ESG factors as a lens for additional fundamental research, which can contribute to investment decision-making.\n\nThe Adviser seeks to understand how environmental and social initiatives within companies can create value by strengthening durable competitive advantages, creating growth opportunities, driving profitability and/or aligning with secular growth trends.", "The Adviser generally engages with company management teams to discuss their ESG practices, with the aim of identifying how sustainability themes present opportunities and risks that can be material to the value of the security over the long-term.\n\nOther aspects of the investment process include a proprietary, systematic evaluation of governance policies, specifically focusing on compensation alignment on long-term value creation.\n\nAlthough consideration of ESG factors is incorporated into the investment process, it is only one of many tools the Adviser utilizes to make investment decisions.\n\nCommon stock is a share ownership or equity interest in a corporation.\n\nIt may or may not pay dividends, as some companies reinvest all of their profits back into their businesses, while others pay out some of their profits to shareholders as dividends.", "In pursuing the Fund\u2019s investment objective, the Adviser has considerable leeway in deciding which investments it buys, holds or sells on a day-to-day basis and which trading strategies it uses.\n\nFor example, the Adviser in its discretion may determine to use some permitted trading strategies while not using others.\n\nAdditional Information About Fund Investment Strategies and Principal Risks\n\nThis section discusses additional information relating to the Fund\u2019s investment strategies, other types of investments that the Fund may make and related risk factors.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s investment practices and limitations are also described in more detail in the Statement of Additional Information (\u201cSAI\u201d), which is incorporated by reference and legally is a part of this Prospectus.\n\nFor details on how to obtain a copy of the SAI and other reports and information, see the back cover of this Prospectus.", "Economies and financial markets worldwide have recently experienced periods of increased volatility, uncertainty, distress, government spending, inflation and disruption to consumer demand, economic output and supply chains.\n\nTo the extent these conditions continue, the risks associated with an investment in the Fund, including those described below, could be heightened and the Fund\u2019s investments (and thus a shareholder\u2019s investment in the Fund) may be particularly susceptible to sudden and substantial losses, reduced yield or income or other adverse developments.\n\nThe occurrence, duration and extent of these or other types of adverse economic and market conditions and uncertainty over the long term cannot be reasonably projected or estimated at this time.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus  |  Fund Details\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\nFixed-Income Securities.\n\nThe Fund also may invest up to 35% of its net assets in investment grade fixed-income securities.", "Fixed-income securities are debt securities such as bonds, notes or commercial paper.\n\nThe issuer of the debt security borrows money from the investor who buys the security.\n\nMost debt securities pay either fixed or adjustable rates of interest at regular intervals until they mature, at which point investors get their principal back.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s fixed-income investments may include zero coupon securities.\n\nREITs and Foreign Real Estate Companies.\n\nThe Fund may invest in real estate investment trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d) and foreign real estate companies, which are similar to entities organized and operated as REITs in the United States.\n\nREITs and foreign real estate companies pool investor funds for investments primarily in real estate properties or real estate-related loans.\n\nThey may also include among other businesses, real estate developers, brokers and operating companies whose products and services are significantly related to the real estate industry such as building suppliers and mortgage lenders.", "Derivatives.\n\nThe Fund may, but it is not required to, use derivative instruments for a variety of purposes, including hedging, risk management, portfolio management or to seek to earn income.\n\nA derivative is a financial instrument whose value is based, in part, on the value of an underlying asset, interest rate, index or financial instrument.\n\nPrevailing interest rates and volatility levels, among other things, also affect the value of derivative instruments.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s use of derivatives may involve the purchase and sale of derivative instruments such as futures, options, swaps, structured investments and other related instruments and techniques.\n\nTemporary Defensive Investments", "Under adverse or unstable market conditions or abnormal circumstances or when the Adviser believes that changes in market, economic, political or other conditions warrant, the Fund may, in the discretion of the Adviser, take temporary positions that are inconsistent with the Fund\u2019s principal investment strategy in attempting to respond to such conditions or circumstances.\n\nFor example, the Fund may invest without limit in cash, cash equivalents or other fixed-income instruments, derivatives, repurchase agreements or securities of other investment companies (including those which may be managed by the Adviser or its affiliates), including money market funds, for temporary purposes.\n\nIf the Adviser incorrectly predicts the effects of these changes or during periods of temporary defensive or other temporary positions, such temporary investments may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s performance and the Fund may not achieve its investment objective.", "The percentage limitations relating to the composition of the Fund\u2019s portfolio apply at the time the Fund acquires an investment.\n\nSubsequent percentage changes that result from market fluctuations generally will not require the Fund to sell any portfolio security.\n\nHowever, the Fund may be required to reduce its borrowings, if any, in response to fluctuations in the value of such holdings.\n\nThe Fund may change its principal investment strategies without shareholder approval; however, you would be notified of any changes.\n\nAdditional Information About the Fund\n\nThere is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s share price and return will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities.\n\nWhen you sell Fund shares, they may be worth less than what you paid for them and, accordingly, you can lose money investing in this Fund.\n\nEquity Securities", "Equity securities may include common and preferred stocks, convertible securities and equity-linked securities, rights and warrants to purchase common stocks, depositary receipts, shares of investment companies, limited partnership interests and other specialty securities having equity features.\n\nMany factors affect the value of equity securities, including earnings, earnings forecasts, corporate events and factors impacting the issuer\u2019s industry and the market generally.\n\nThe Fund may invest in equity securities that are publicly traded on securities exchanges or over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) or in equity securities that are not publicly traded.\n\nSecurities that are not publicly traded may be more difficult to value or sell and their value may fluctuate more dramatically than other securities.\n\nThe prices of convertible securities are affected by changes similar to those of equity and fixed-income securities.", "The value of equity securities and related instruments may decline in response to adverse changes in the economy or the economic outlook; deterioration in investor sentiment; interest rate, currency, and commodity price fluctuations; adverse geopolitical, social or environmental developments; issuer- and sector-specific considerations; unexpected trading activity among retail investors; and other factors.\n\nMarket conditions may affect certain types of stocks to a greater extent than other types of stocks.\n\nIf the stock market declines, the value of Fund shares will also likely decline.\n\nAlthough stock prices can rebound, there is no assurance that values will return to previous levels.\n\nDuring periods when equity securities experience heightened volatility, such as during periods of market, economic or financial uncertainty or distress, the Fund\u2019s investments in equity securities may be subject to heightened risks.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus | Fund Details", "Insight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\nDepositary Receipts\n\nA depositary receipt is generally issued by a bank or financial institution and represents the common stock or other equity securities of a foreign company.\n\nDepositary receipts involve many of the same risks as those associated with direct investment in foreign securities.\n\nIn addition, the underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts, particularly unsponsored or unregistered depositary receipts, are under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications to the holders of such receipts, or to pass through to them any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities.\n\nConvertible Securities\n\nA convertible security is a bond, debenture, note, preferred stock, right, warrant or other security that may be converted into or exchanged for a prescribed amount of common stock or other security of the same or a different issuer or into cash within a particular period of time at a specified price or formula.", "A convertible security generally entitles the holder to receive interest paid or accrued on debt securities or the dividend paid on preferred stock until the convertible security matures or is redeemed, converted or exchanged.\n\nBefore conversion, convertible securities generally have characteristics similar to both debt and equity securities.\n\nThe value of convertible securities tends to decline as interest rates rise and, because of the conversion feature, tends to vary with fluctuations in the market value of the underlying securities.\n\nConvertible securities ordinarily provide a stream of income with generally higher yields than those of common stock of the same or similar issuers.\n\nConvertible securities generally rank senior to common stock in a corporation\u2019s capital structure but are usually subordinated to other comparable nonconvertible fixed-income securities in such capital structure.", "Convertible securities generally do not participate directly in any dividend increases or decreases of the underlying securities although the market prices of convertible securities may be affected by any dividend changes or other changes in the underlying securities.\n\nSmall and Mid Cap Companies\n\nThe Fund\u2019s investments in small and mid cap companies carry more risk than investments in larger companies.\n\nWhile some of the Fund\u2019s holdings in these companies may be listed on a national securities exchange, such securities are more likely to be traded in the OTC market.\n\nThe low market liquidity of these securities may have an adverse impact on the Fund\u2019s ability to sell certain securities at favorable prices and may also make it difficult for the Fund to obtain market quotations based on actual trades for purposes of valuing the Fund\u2019s securities.", "Investing in lesser-known, small and mid cap companies involves greater risk of volatility of the Fund\u2019s NAV than is customarily associated with larger, more established companies.\n\nIn addition, at times, small and mid cap growth-oriented equity securities may underperform relative to the overall market.\n\nGrowth stocks may trade at higher multiples of current earnings compared to other styles of investing (e.g., \u201cvalue\u201d), leading to inflated prices and thus potentially greater declines in value.\n\nOften small and mid cap companies and the industries in which they are focused are still evolving and, while this may offer better growth potential than larger, more established companies, it also may make them more sensitive to changing market conditions.\n\nForeign Securities\n\nForeign issuers generally are subject to different accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards than U.S. issuers.\n\nThere may be less information available to the public about foreign issuers.", "Securities of foreign issuers can be less liquid and experience greater price movements.\n\nIn addition, the prices of such securities may be susceptible to influence by large traders, due to the limited size of many foreign securities markets.\n\nMoreover, investments in certain foreign markets that have historically been considered stable may become more volatile and subject to increased risk due to developments and changing conditions in such markets.\n\nAlso, the growing interconnectivity of global economies and financial markets has increased the probability that adverse developments and conditions in one country or region will affect the stability of economies and financial markets in other countries or regions.\n\nIn some foreign countries, there is also the risk of government expropriation, excessive taxation, political or social instability, the imposition of currency controls or diplomatic developments that could affect the Fund\u2019s investment.", "There also can be difficulty obtaining and enforcing judgments against issuers in foreign countries.\n\nForeign stock exchanges, broker-dealers and listed issuers may be subject to less government regulation and oversight.\n\nThe cost of investing in foreign securities, including brokerage commissions and custodial expenses, can be higher than the cost of investing in domestic securities.\n\nCertain foreign markets may rely heavily on particular industries or foreign capital and are more vulnerable to diplomatic developments, the imposition of economic sanctions against a particular country or countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals, changes in international trading patterns, trade barriers and other protectionist or retaliatory measures.\n\nInternational trade barriers or economic sanctions against foreign countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s foreign holdings or exposures.", "Investments in foreign markets may also be adversely affected by less stringent investor protections and disclosure standards, and governmental actions such as the imposition of capital controls, nationalization of companies or industries, expropriation of assets or the imposition of punitive taxes.\n\nGovernmental actions can have a significant effect on the economic conditions in foreign countries, which also may adversely affect the value and liquidity of the Fund\u2019s investments.\n\nForeign investment in the securities markets of certain foreign countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees.\n\nFor example, the governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investing in their capital markets or in certain sectors or industries.", "In addition, a foreign government may limit or cause delay in the convertibility or repatriation of its currency which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value and/or liquidity of investments denominated in that currency.\n\nMoreover, if a deterioration occurs in a country\u2019s balance of payments, the country could impose temporary restrictions on\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus  |  Fund Details\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\nforeign capital remittances.\n\nThe Fund could also be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required governmental approval for repatriation, as well as by the application to it of other restrictions on investment.\n\nAny of these actions could severely affect security prices, which could result in losses to the Fund and increased transaction costs, impair the Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or sell foreign securities or transfer the Fund\u2019s assets back into the United States, or otherwise adversely affect the Fund\u2019s operations.", "Certain foreign investments may become less liquid in response to market developments or adverse investor perceptions, or become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil.\n\nCertain foreign investments may become illiquid when, for instance, there are few, if any, interested buyers and sellers or when dealers are unwilling to make a market for certain securities.\n\nWhen the Fund holds illiquid investments, its portfolio may be harder to value.\n\nEconomic sanctions or other similar measures may be, and have been, imposed against certain countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s investments in foreign securities are subject to trade laws and potential economic sanctions in the United States and other jurisdictions.\n\nThese laws and related governmental actions, including counter-sanctions and other retaliatory measures, can, from time to time, prevent or prohibit the Fund from investing in certain foreign securities.", "In addition, economic sanctions could prohibit the Fund from transacting with particular countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals by banning them from global payment systems that facilitate cross-border payments, restricting their ability to settle securities transactions, and freezing their assets.\n\nThe imposition of sanctions and other similar measures could, among other things, cause a decline in the value of securities issued by the sanctioned country or companies located in, or economically linked to, the sanctioned country, downgrades in the credit ratings of the sanctioned country or companies located in, or economically linked to, the sanctioned country, devaluation of the sanctioned country\u2019s currency, and increased market volatility and disruption in the sanctioned country and throughout the world.", "Economic sanctions or other similar measures could, among other things, effectively restrict or eliminate the Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or sell securities, negatively impact the value or liquidity of the Fund\u2019s investments, significantly delay or prevent the settlement of the Fund\u2019s securities transactions, force the Fund to sell or otherwise dispose of investments at inopportune times or prices, increase the Fund\u2019s transaction costs, make the Fund\u2019s investments more difficult to value or impair the Fund\u2019s ability to meet its investment objective or invest in accordance with its investment strategies.\n\nThese conditions may be in place for a substantial period of time and enacted with limited advance notice to the Fund.", "Even if the Fund does not have significant investments in securities affected by sanctions, sanctions or the threat of sanctions may cause volatility in regional and global markets and may negatively impact the performance of various sectors and industries, as well as companies in other countries, including through global supply chain disruptions, increased inflationary pressures, and reduced economic activity, which could have a negative effect on the Fund\u2019s performance.\n\nIn addition, trade disputes may affect investor and consumer confidence and adversely affect financial markets and the broader economy, perhaps suddenly and to a significant degree.\n\nEvents such as these and their impact on the Fund are difficult to predict.", "In addition, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the \u201cHFCAA\u201d) could cause securities of a foreign (non-U.S.) company, including American Depositary Receipts, to be delisted from U.S. stock exchanges if the company does not allow the U.S. government to oversee the auditing of its financial information.\n\nAlthough the requirements of the HFCAA apply to securities of all foreign (non-U.S.) issuers, the SEC has thus far limited its enforcement efforts to securities of Chinese companies.\n\nIf securities are delisted, the Fund\u2019s ability to transact in such securities will be impaired, and the liquidity and market price of the securities may decline.\n\nThe Fund may also need to seek other markets in which to transact in such securities, which could increase the Fund\u2019s costs.\n\nIn connection with its investments in foreign securities, the Fund also may enter into contracts with banks, brokers or dealers to purchase or sell securities or foreign currencies at a future date.", "A foreign currency forward exchange contract is a negotiated agreement between the contracting parties to exchange a specified amount of currency at a specified future time at a specified rate.\n\nThe rate can be higher or lower than the spot rate between the currencies that are the subject of the contract.\n\nForeign currency forward exchange contracts may be used to seek to protect against uncertainty in the level of future foreign currency exchange rates or to gain or modify exposure to a particular currency.\n\nIn addition, the Fund may use cross currency hedging or proxy hedging with respect to currencies in which the Fund has or expects to have portfolio or currency exposure.\n\nCross currency and proxy hedges involve the sale of one currency against the positive exposure to a different currency and may be used for hedging purposes or to establish an active exposure to the exchange rate between any two currencies.", "To the extent hedged by the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts, the precise matching of the foreign currency forward exchange contract amounts and the value of the securities involved will not generally be possible because the future value of such securities in foreign currencies will change as a consequence of market movements in the value of those securities between the date on which the contract is entered into and the date it matures.\n\nFurthermore, such transactions may reduce or preclude the opportunity for gain if the value of the currency should move in the direction opposite to the position taken.\n\nThere is an additional risk to the extent that foreign currency forward exchange contracts create exposure to currencies in which the Fund\u2019s securities are not denominated.\n\nUnanticipated changes in currency prices may result in poorer overall performance for the Fund than if it had not entered into such contracts.", "The use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts involves the risk of loss from the insolvency or bankruptcy of the counterparty to the contract or the failure of the counterparty to make payments or otherwise comply with the terms of the contract.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus | Fund Details\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\nEmerging Market Securities\n\nThe Fund may invest in emerging market or developing countries, which are countries that major international financial institutions generally consider to be less economically mature than developed nations (such as the United States or most nations in Western Europe).\n\nEmerging market or developing countries may be more likely to experience political turmoil or rapid changes in economic conditions than more developed countries, and the financial condition of issuers in emerging market or developing countries may be more precarious than in other countries.", "Certain emerging market countries may be subject to less stringent requirements regarding accounting, auditing, financial reporting and record keeping and therefore, material information related to an investment may not be available or reliable.\n\nIn addition, the Fund is limited in its ability to exercise its legal rights or enforce a counterparty\u2019s legal obligations in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States, in particular, in emerging markets countries.\n\nIn addition, due to jurisdictional limitations, U.S. authorities (e.g., SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice) may be limited in their ability to enforce regulatory or legal obligations in emerging market countries.\n\nIn addition, emerging market securities generally are less liquid and subject to wider price and currency fluctuations than securities issued in more developed countries.", "These characteristics result in greater risk of price volatility in emerging market or developing countries, which may be heightened by currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\nFocused Investing\n\nAlthough the Fund is a diversified investment company under the 1940 Act, the Fund typically invests a significant portion of its portfolio in a limited number of issuers, which may be in the same industry, sector or geographic region.\n\nAs a result, the Fund will be more susceptible to risks associated with, and negative events, conditions or developments affecting or economic results of, those issuers, industries, sectors or geographic regions, and a decline in the value of a particular instrument may cause the Fund\u2019s overall value to be more volatile and decline to a greater degree than if the Fund were invested more widely.\n\nSuch volatility and decline may be sudden and significant.", "In addition, if such issuers are within the same market segment or of a similar type (e.g., growth stocks), the Fund will be more sensitive to adverse developments or conditions and risks affecting such market segment or type of issuer, including that the market segment or type of issuer may fall out of favor, than if the Fund were invested more widely.\n\nThe Fund does not lose its status as a diversified investment company because of any subsequent discrepancy between the value of its various investments and the diversification requirements of the 1940 Act, so long as any such discrepancy existing immediately after the Fund\u2019s acquisition of any security or other property is neither wholly nor partly the result of such acquisition.\n\nLiquidity", "The Fund may make investments that are illiquid or restricted or that may become illiquid or less liquid in response to, among other developments, overall economic conditions or adverse investor perceptions, and which may entail greater risk than investments in other types of securities.\n\nIlliquidity can also be caused by, among other things, a drop in overall market trading volume, an inability to find a willing buyer, or legal restrictions on the securities\u2019 resale.\n\nThese investments may be more difficult to value or sell, particularly in times of market turmoil, and there may be little trading in the secondary market available for particular securities.\n\nIf the Fund is forced to sell an illiquid or restricted security to fund redemptions or for other cash needs, it may be forced to sell the security at a loss or for less than its fair value and may be unable to sell the security at all.\n\nMarket and Geopolitical Risk", "The value of your investment in the Fund is based on the values of the Fund\u2019s investments, which change due to economic and other events that affect markets generally, as well as those that affect particular regions, countries, industries, companies or governments.\n\nPrice movements, sometimes called volatility, may be greater or less depending on the types of securities the Fund owns and the markets in which the securities trade.\n\nVolatility and disruption in financial markets and economies may be sudden and unexpected, expose the Fund to greater risk, including risks associated with reduced market liquidity and fair valuation, and adversely affect the Fund\u2019s operations.\n\nFor example, the Adviser potentially will be prevented from executing investment decisions at an advantageous time or price as a result of any domestic or global market disruptions and reduced market liquidity may impact the Fund\u2019s ability to sell securities to meet redemptions.", "The increasing interconnectivity between global economies and markets increases the likelihood that events or conditions in one region or market may adversely impact other companies and issuers in a different country, region, sector, industry, market or with respect to one company may adversely impact issuers in a different country, region, sector, industry, or market.\n\nFor example, adverse developments in the banking or financial services sector could impact companies operating in various sectors or industries and adversely impact the Fund\u2019s investments.\n\nSecurities in the Fund\u2019s portfolio may underperform due to inflation (or expectations for inflation), interest rates, global demand for particular products or resources, natural disasters and extreme weather events, health emergencies (such as epidemics and pandemics), terrorism, regulatory events and governmental or quasi-governmental actions.", "The occurrence of global events, such as terrorist attacks around the world, natural disasters, health emergencies, social and political (including geopolitical) discord and tensions or debt crises and downgrades, among others, may result in market volatility and may have long term effects on both the U.S. and global financial markets.\n\nInflation rates may change frequently and significantly because of various factors, including unexpected shifts in the domestic or global economy and changes in monetary or economic policies (or expectations that these policies may change).\n\nChanges in expected inflation rates may adversely affect market and economic conditions, the Fund\u2019s investments and an investment in the Fund.\n\nThe market price of debt securities generally falls as inflation\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus  |  Fund Details\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)", "increases because the purchasing power of the future income and repaid principal is expected to be worth less when received by the Fund.\n\nThe risk of inflation is greater for debt instruments with longer maturities and especially those that pay a fixed rather than variable interest rate.\n\nOther financial, economic and other global market and social developments or disruptions may result in similar adverse circumstances, and it is difficult to predict when similar events affecting the U.S. or global financial markets may occur, the effects that such events may have and the duration of those effects (which may last for extended periods).\n\nIn general, the securities or other instruments that the Adviser believes represent an attractive investment opportunity or in which the Fund seeks to invest may be unavailable entirely or in the specific quantities sought by the Fund.", "As a result, the Fund may need to obtain the desired exposure through a less advantageous investment, forgo the investment at the time or seek to replicate the desired exposure through a derivative transaction or investment in another investment vehicle.\n\nAny such event(s) could have a significant adverse impact on the value and risk profile of the Fund\u2019s portfolio.\n\nThere is a risk that you may lose money by investing in the Fund.", "Social, political, economic and other conditions and events, such as war, natural disasters, health emergencies (e.g., epidemics and pandemics), terrorism, conflicts, social unrest, recessions, inflation, interest rate changes and supply chain disruptions could reduce consumer demand or economic output, result in market closures, travel restrictions or quarantines, and generally have a significant impact on the economies and financial markets and the Adviser\u2019s investment advisory activities and services of other service providers, which in turn could adversely affect the Fund\u2019s investments and other operations.\n\nGovernment and other public debt, including municipal obligations in which the Fund may invest, can be adversely affected by changes in local and global economic conditions that result in increased debt levels.", "Although high levels of government and other public debt do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, high levels of debt may create certain systemic risks if sound debt management practices are not implemented.\n\nA high debt level may increase market pressures to meet an issuer\u2019s funding needs, which may increase borrowing costs and cause a government or public or municipal entity to issue additional debt, thereby increasing the risk of refinancing.\n\nA high debt level also raises concerns that the issuer may be unable or unwilling to repay the principal or interest on its debt, which may adversely impact instruments held by the Fund that rely on such payments.\n\nGovernmental and quasi-governmental responses to certain economic or other conditions may lead to increasing government and other public debt, which heighten these risks.", "Unsustainable debt levels can lead to declines in the value of currency, and can prevent a government from implementing effective counter-cyclical fiscal policy during economic downturns, can generate or contribute to an economic downturn or cause other adverse economic or market developments, such as increases in inflation or volatility.\n\nIncreasing government and other public debt may adversely affect issuers, obligors, guarantors or instruments across a variety of asset classes.\n\nGlobal events may negatively impact broad segments of businesses and populations, cause a significant negative impact on the performance of the Fund\u2019s investments, adversely affect and increase the volatility of the Fund\u2019s share price, exacerbate pre-existing political, social and economic risks to the Fund.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s operations may be interrupted as a result, which may contribute to the negative impact on investment performance.", "In addition, governments, their regulatory agencies, or self-regulatory organizations may take actions that affect the instruments in which the Fund invests, or the issuers of such instruments, in ways that could have a significant negative impact on the Fund\u2019s investment performance.\n\nIn addition, government actions (such as changes to interest rates) could have unintended economic and market consequences that adversely affect the Fund\u2019s investments.\n\nPrivate Placements and Restricted Securities\n\nThe Fund\u2019s investments may include privately placed securities, which are subject to resale restrictions.\n\nThese securities could have the effect of increasing the level of Fund illiquidity to the extent the Fund may be unable to sell or transfer these securities due to restrictions on transfers or on the ability to find buyers interested in purchasing the securities.", "Additionally, the market for certain investments deemed liquid at the time of purchase may become illiquid under adverse market or economic conditions.\n\nThe illiquidity of the market, as well as the lack of publicly available information regarding these securities, may also adversely affect the ability to arrive at a fair value for certain securities at certain times and could make it difficult for the Fund to sell certain securities.\n\nIf the Fund is forced to sell an illiquid security to fund redemptions or for other cash needs, it may be forced to sell the security at a loss or for less than its fair value.\n\nInformation Technology Sector Risk", "To the extent the Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the information technology sector, the value of Fund shares may be particularly impacted by events that adversely affect the information technology sector, such as rapid changes in technology product cycles, competition for the services of qualified personnel and government regulation.\n\nThe products of information technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction and unpredictable changes in growth rates.\n\nCompanies in the information technology sector also can be heavily dependent on patent protection and the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.\n\nAs a result, the value of shares may fluctuate more than that of a fund that does not invest significantly in companies in the technology sector.\n\nOther Risks.", "The performance of the Fund also will depend on whether or not the Adviser is successful in applying the Fund\u2019s investment strategies.\n\nThe Fund is also subject to other risks from its permissible investments, including the risks associated with\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus | Fund Details\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\nits investments in fixed-income securities, REITs and foreign real estate companies, and derivatives.\n\nFor more information about these and other risks, see the \u201cAdditional Risk Information\u201d section below.\n\nAdditional Risk Information\n\nThis section provides additional information relating to the risks of investing in the Fund.\n\nFixed-Income Securities\n\nFixed-income securities are securities that pay a fixed or a variable rate of interest until a stated maturity date.", "Fixed-income securities include U.S. government securities, securities issued by federal or federally sponsored agencies and instrumentalities, corporate bonds and notes, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, securities rated below investment grade (commonly referred to as \u201cjunk bonds\u201d or \u201chigh yield/high risk securities\u201d), municipal bonds, loan participations and assignments, zero coupon bonds, convertible securities, Eurobonds, Brady Bonds, Yankee Bonds, repurchase agreements, commercial paper and cash equivalents.\n\nFixed-income securities are subject to the risk of the issuer\u2019s inability to meet principal and interest payments on its obligations (i.e., credit risk) and are subject to price volatility resulting from, among other things, interest rate sensitivity (i.e., interest rate risk), market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (i.e., market risk).", "For example, a type of fixed-income securities in which the Fund may invest are corporate debt obligations.\n\nIn addition to interest rate, credit and other risks, corporate debt obligations are also subject to factors directly related to the issuer, such as the credit rating of the corporation, the corporation\u2019s performance and perceptions of the corporation in the marketplace, and by factors not directly related to the issuer, such as general market liquidity, economic conditions and inflation.\n\nThe Fund may face a heightened level of interest rate risk in times of monetary policy change and/or uncertainty, such as when the Federal Reserve Board adjusts a quantitative easing program and/or changes rates.\n\nA changing interest rate environment increases certain risks, including the potential for periods of volatility, increased redemptions, shortened durations (i.e., prepayment risk) and extended durations (i.e., extension risk).", "Fixed income and other debt instruments, including mortgage- and other asset-backed securities, are subject to prepayment risk, which is the risk that the principal of such obligation is paid earlier than expected, such as in the case of refinancing.\n\nThis risk is increased during periods of declining interest rates and prepayments may reduce the Fund\u2019s yield or income as a result of reinvesting the income or other proceeds in lower yielding securities or instruments.\n\nThese investments are also subject to extension risk, which is the risk that the principal of such obligation is paid slower or later than expected.\n\nThis may negatively affect Fund returns, as the value of the investment decreases when principal payments are made later than expected.\n\nThis risk is elevated during periods of increasing interest rates.", "In addition, because principal payments are made later than expected, the investment\u2019s duration may extend (and result in increased interest rate risk) and the Fund may be prevented from investing proceeds it would otherwise have received at the higher prevailing interest rates.\n\nPrepayments and extensions may result in a security or debt instrument offering less potential for gains during periods of declining interest rates or rising interest rates, respectively.\n\nSecurities with longer durations are likely to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates, generally making them more volatile than securities with shorter durations.\n\nLower rated fixed-income securities have greater volatility because there is less certainty that principal and interest payments will be made as scheduled.\n\nA portion of the Fund\u2019s fixed-income securities may be rated below investment grade.", "The Fund may be subject to liquidity risk, which may result from the lack of an active market and the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in fixed-income securities.\n\nFixed-income securities may be called (i.e., redeemed by the issuer) prior to final maturity.\n\nIf a callable security is called, the Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds at a lower rate of interest.\n\nREITs and Foreign Real Estate Companies\n\nInvesting in REITs and foreign real estate companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly and investing in companies in the real estate industry, including the risks associated with residential and commercial real estate, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which REITs and foreign real estate companies are organized and operated.\n\nREITs and foreign real estate companies generally invest directly in real estate, in mortgages or in some combination of the two.", "Real estate income and values may also be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changing tastes, preferences (such as remote work arrangements) and values.\n\nOperating REITs and foreign real estate companies requires specialized management skills and the Fund indirectly bears management expenses along with the direct expenses of the Fund.\n\nThe value of REIT and foreign real estate company securities will also rise and fall in response to the management skill and creditworthiness of the issuer.\n\nIn particular, the value of these securities may decline when interest rates rise and will also be affected by the real estate market and by the management or development of the underlying properties, which may also be subject to mortgage loans and the underlying mortgage loans may be subject to the risks of default.", "REITs may be more volatile and/or more illiquid than other types of securities, and publicly traded REIT and real estate company shares are also subject to risks associated with equity securities.\n\nIn addition, individual REITs and foreign real estate companies may own a limited number of properties and may concentrate in a particular region or property type.\n\nREITs may also be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers or tenants and self-liquidation.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus  |  Fund Details\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\nREITs also must satisfy specific requirements of the Code in order to qualify for tax-free pass-through income.\n\nThe failure of a company to qualify as a REIT could have adverse consequences for the Fund, including significantly reducing the return to the Fund on its investment in such company.", "Foreign real estate companies may be subject to laws, rules and regulations governing those entities and their failure to comply with those laws, rules and regulations could negatively impact the performance of those entities.\n\nIn addition, REITs and foreign real estate companies, like mutual funds, have expenses, including management and administration fees, that are paid by their shareholders.\n\nAs a result, shareholders will directly bear the expenses of their investment in the Fund and indirectly bear the expenses of the Fund\u2019s investments when the Fund invests in REITs and foreign real estate companies.\n\nDerivatives\n\nThe Fund may, but is not required to, use derivatives and other similar instruments for a variety of purposes, including hedging, risk management, portfolio management or to seek to earn income.", "Derivative instruments used by the Fund will be counted towards the Fund\u2019s exposure in the types of securities listed herein to the extent they have economic characteristics similar to such securities.\n\nA derivative is a financial instrument whose value is based, in part, on the value of an underlying asset, interest rate, index or financial instrument.\n\nPrevailing interest rates and volatility levels, among other things, also affect the value of derivative instruments.", "Derivatives and other similar instruments that create synthetic exposure often are subject to risks similar to those of the underlying asset or instrument and may be subject to additional risks, including imperfect correlation between the value of the derivative and the underlying asset, risks of default by the counterparty to certain transactions, magnification of losses incurred due to changes in the market value of the securities, instruments, indices or interest rates to which the derivative instrument relates, risks that the transactions may not be liquid, risks arising from margin and payment requirements, risks arising from mispricing or valuation complexity and operational and legal risks.\n\nThe use of derivatives involves risks that are different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with other portfolio investments.", "Derivatives may involve the use of highly specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analyses different from those associated with other portfolio investments.\n\nCertain derivative transactions may give rise to a form of leverage.\n\nLeverage magnifies the potential for gain and the risk of loss.\n\nLeverage associated with derivative transactions may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so, or may cause the Fund to be more volatile than if the Fund had not been leveraged.\n\nAlthough the Adviser seeks to use derivatives to further the Fund\u2019s investment objective, there is no assurance that the use of derivatives will achieve this result.\n\nThe derivative instruments and techniques that the Fund may use include:\n\nFutures.\n\nA futures contract is a standardized, exchange-traded agreement to buy or sell a specific quantity of an underlying asset, reference rate or index at a specific price at a specific future time.", "While the value of a futures contract tends to increase or decrease in tandem with the value of the underlying instrument, differences between the futures market and the market for the underlying asset may result in an imperfect correlation.\n\nDepending on the terms of the particular contract, futures contracts are settled through either physical delivery of the underlying instrument on the settlement date or by payment of a cash settlement amount on the settlement date.\n\nA decision as to whether, when and how to use futures contracts involves the exercise of skill and judgment and even a well-conceived futures transaction may be unsuccessful because of market behavior or unexpected events.\n\nIn addition to the derivatives risks discussed above, the prices of futures contracts can be highly volatile, using futures contracts can lower total return, and the potential loss from futures contracts can exceed the Fund\u2019s initial investment in such contracts.", "No assurance can be given that a liquid market will exist for any particular futures contract at any particular time.\n\nThere is also the risk of loss by the Fund of margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker with which the Fund has open positions in the futures contract.\n\nOptions.\n\nIf the Fund buys an option, it buys a legal contract giving it the right to buy or sell a specific amount of the underlying instrument, foreign currency or contract, such as a swap agreement or futures contract, on the underlying instrument or foreign currency at an agreed-upon price typically in exchange for a premium paid by the Fund.\n\nIf the Fund sells an option, it sells to another person the right to buy from or sell to the Fund a specific amount of the underlying instrument, swap, foreign currency, or futures contract on the underlying instrument or foreign currency at an agreed-upon price during a period of time or on a specified date typically in exchange for a premium received by the Fund.", "When options are purchased OTC, the Fund bears the risk that the counterparty that wrote the option will be unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the option contract.\n\nOptions may also be illiquid and the Fund may have difficulty closing out its position.\n\nA decision as to whether, when and how to use options involves the exercise of skill and judgment and even a well-conceived option transaction may be unsuccessful because of market behavior or unexpected events.\n\nThe prices of options can be highly volatile and the use of options can lower total returns.\n\nInvestments in foreign currency options may substantially change the Fund\u2019s exposure to currency exchange rates and could result in losses to the Fund if currencies do not perform as the Adviser expects.\n\nThere is a risk that such transactions may reduce or preclude the opportunity for gain if the value of the currency should move in the direction opposite to the position taken.", "The value of a foreign currency option is dependent upon the value of the underlying foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar or other applicable foreign currency.\n\nThe price of the option may vary with changes in the value of either or both currencies and has no relationship to the investment merits of a foreign security.\n\nOptions on foreign currencies are affected by all of those factors that influence foreign exchange rates and foreign investment generally.\n\nUnanticipated changes in currency prices may result in losses to the Fund and\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus | Fund Details\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\npoorer overall performance for the Fund than if it had not entered into such contracts.\n\nOptions on foreign currencies are traded primarily in the OTC market, but may also be traded on U.S. and foreign exchanges.", "Foreign currency options contracts may be used for hedging purposes or non-hedging purposes in pursuing the Fund\u2019s investment objective, such as when the Adviser anticipates that particular non-U.S. currencies will appreciate or depreciate in value, even though securities denominated in those currencies are not then held in the Fund\u2019s investment portfolio.\n\nInvesting in foreign currencies for purposes of gaining from projected changes in exchange rates, as opposed to only hedging currency risks applicable to the Fund\u2019s holdings, further increases the Fund\u2019s exposure to foreign securities losses.\n\nThere is no assurance that the Adviser\u2019s use of currency derivatives will benefit the Fund or that they will be, or can be, used at appropriate times.\n\nSwaps.\n\nThe Fund may enter into OTC swap contracts or cleared swap transactions.", "An OTC swap contract is an agreement between two parties pursuant to which the parties exchange payments at specified dates on the basis of a specified notional amount, with the payments calculated by reference to specified securities, indices, reference rates, currencies or other instruments.\n\nTypically swap agreements provide that when the period payment dates for both parties are the same, the payments are made on a net basis (i.e., the two payment streams are netted out, with only the net amount paid by one party to the other).\n\nThe Fund\u2019s obligations or rights under a swap contract entered into on a net basis will generally be equal only to the net amount to be paid or received under the agreement, based on the relative values of the positions held by each party.\n\nCleared swap transactions may help reduce counterparty credit risk.\n\nIn a cleared swap, the Fund\u2019s ultimate counterparty is a clearinghouse rather than a swap dealer, bank or other financial institution.", "OTC swap agreements are not entered into or traded on exchanges and often there is no central clearing or guaranty function for swaps.\n\nThese OTC swaps are often subject to credit risk or the risk of default or non-performance by the counterparty.\n\nCertain swaps have begun trading on exchanges called swap execution facilities.\n\nExchange trading is expected to increase liquidity of swaps trading.\n\nBoth OTC and cleared swaps could result in losses if interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or other factors are not correctly anticipated by the Fund or if the reference index, security or investments do not perform as expected.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and related regulatory developments require the clearing and exchange trading of certain standardized swap transactions.\n\nMandatory exchange-trading and clearing is occurring on a phased-in basis.\n\nThe Fund may pay fees or incur costs each time it enters into, amends or terminates a swap agreement.", "Structured Investments.\n\nThe Fund also may invest a portion of its assets in structured investments.\n\nA structured investment is a derivative security designed to offer a return linked to a particular underlying security, currency, commodity or market.\n\nStructured investments may come in various forms including notes (such as exchange-traded notes), warrants and options to purchase securities.\n\nThe Fund will typically use structured investments to gain exposure to a permitted underlying security, currency, commodity or market when direct access to a market is limited or inefficient from a tax or cost standpoint.\n\nThere can be no assurance that structured investments will trade at the same price or have the same value as the underlying security, currency, commodity or market.\n\nInvestments in structured investments involve risks including issuer risk, counterparty risk and market risk.", "Holders of structured investments bear risks of the underlying investment and are subject to issuer or counterparty risk because the Fund is relying on the creditworthiness of such issuer or counterparty and has no rights with respect to the underlying investment.\n\nCertain structured investments may be thinly traded or have a limited trading market and may have the effect of increasing the Fund\u2019s illiquidity to the extent that the Fund, at a particular point in time, may be unable to find qualified buyers for these securities.\n\nESG Investment Risk\n\nTo the extent that the Adviser considers environmental, social and/or governance (\u201cESG\u201d) issues as a component in its investment decision-making process, the Fund\u2019s performance may be impacted.", "Additionally, the Adviser\u2019s consideration of ESG issues in its investment decision-making process may require subjective analysis and the ability of the Adviser to consider ESG issues may be difficult if data about a particular issuer (or obligor) is limited.\n\nThe Adviser\u2019s consideration of ESG issues may contribute to the Adviser\u2019s decision to forgo opportunities to buy certain securities.\n\nESG issues with respect to an issuer (or obligor) or the Adviser\u2019s assessment of such may change over time.\n\nSpecial Purpose Acquisition Companies\n\nA special purpose acquisition company (\u201cSPAC\u201d) is a publicly traded company that raises investment capital for the purpose of acquiring or merging with an existing company.\n\nTypically, the acquisition target is an existing privately held company that wants to trade publicly, which it accomplishes through a combination with a SPAC rather than by conducting a traditional initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d).", "SPACs and similar entities are blank check companies and do not have any operating history or ongoing business other than seeking acquisitions.\n\nThe long term value of a SPAC\u2019s securities is particularly dependent on the ability of the SPAC\u2019s management to identify a merger target and complete an acquisition.\n\nAn investment in a SPAC is subject to the risks that any proposed acquisition or merger may not obtain the requisite approval of SPAC shareholders, may require governmental or other approvals that it fails to obtain or that an acquisition or merger, once effected, may prove unsuccessful and lose value.\n\nIn addition, among other conflicts of interest, the economic interests of the management, directors, officers and related parties of a SPAC can differ from the economic interests of public shareholders, which may lead to conflicts as they evaluate, negotiate and recommend business combination transactions to shareholders.\n\nThis risk may\n\nBack to Table of Contents", "Morgan Stanley Prospectus  |  Fund Details\n\nInsight Fund (Con\u2019t)\n\nbecome more acute as the deadline for the completion of a business combination nears or in the event that attractive acquisition or merger targets become scarce.\n\nAn investment in a SPAC is also subject to the risk that a significant portion of the funds raised by the SPAC may be expended during the search for a target acquisition or merger.\n\nThe value of investments in SPACs may be highly volatile and may depreciate over time.\n\nIn addition, investments in SPACs may be subject to the same risks as investing in any initial public offering, including the risks associated with companies that have little operating history as public companies, including unseasoned trading, small number of shares available for trading and limited information about the issuer.\n\nIn addition, the market for IPO issuers may be volatile, and share prices of newly-public companies have fluctuated significantly over short periods of time.", "Although some IPOs may produce high returns, such returns are not typical and may not be sustainable.\n\nCertain investments in SPACs are privately placed securities and are also subject to the risks of such securities.\n\nLarge Shareholder Transactions Risk\n\nThe Fund may experience adverse effects when certain shareholders, or shareholders collectively, purchase or redeem large amounts of shares of the Fund.\n\nSuch larger than normal redemptions may cause the Fund to sell portfolio securities at times when it would not otherwise do so, which may negatively impact the Fund\u2019s NAV and liquidity.\n\nSimilarly, large Fund share purchases may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s performance to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain a larger cash position than it ordinarily would.\n\nThese transactions may also accelerate the realization of taxable income to shareholders if such sales of investments resulted in gains, and may also increase transaction costs.", "In addition, a large redemption could result in the Fund\u2019s current expenses being allocated over a smaller asset base, leading to an increase in the Fund\u2019s expense ratio.\n\nAlthough large shareholder transactions may be more frequent under certain circumstances, the Fund is generally subject to the risk that shareholders can purchase or redeem a significant percentage of Fund shares at any time.\n\nActive Management Risk\n\nIn pursuing the Fund\u2019s investment objective, the Adviser has considerable leeway in deciding which investments it buys, holds or sells on a day-to-day basis, and which trading strategies it uses.\n\nFor example, the Adviser, in its discretion, may determine to use some permitted trading strategies while not using others.\n\nThe success or failure of such decisions will affect the Fund\u2019s performance.\n\nIn addition, it is expected that confidential or material non-public information regarding an investment or potential investment opportunity may become available to the Adviser.", "If such information becomes available, the Adviser may be precluded (including by applicable law or internal policies or procedures) from pursuing an investment or disposition opportunity with respect to such investment or investment opportunity and the Adviser may be restricted in its ability to cause the Fund to buy or sell securities of an issuer for substantial periods of time when the Fund otherwise could realize profit or avoid loss.\n\nThis may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s flexibility with respect to buying or selling securities and may impair the Fund\u2019s liquidity.\n\nRegulatory and Legal Risk\n\nU.S. and non-U.S. governmental agencies and other regulators regularly implement additional regulations and legislators pass new laws that affect the investments held by the Fund, the strategies used by the Fund or the level of regulation or taxation applying to the Fund (such as regulations related to investments in derivatives and other transactions).", "These regulations and laws impact the investment strategies, performance, costs and operations of the Fund or taxation of shareholders.\n\nThe SEC has recently proposed amendments to Rule 22e-4 of the 1940 Act that, if adopted, would result in changes to the Fund\u2019s liquidity classification framework and could potentially increase the percentage of the Fund\u2019s investments classified as illiquid.\n\nIn addition, the Fund\u2019s operations and investment strategies may be adversely impacted if the proposed amendments are adopted.\n\nPortfolio Holdings\n\nA description of the Fund\u2019s policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities is available in the Fund\u2019s SAI.\n\nFund Management\n\nThe Fund has retained the Adviser\u2014Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc.\u2014to provide investment advisory services.", "The Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley (NYSE: \u201cMS\u201d), a preeminent global financial services firm engaged in securities trading and brokerage activities, as well as providing investment

composition of Counterpoint Global may change from time to time.", "The Fund pays the Adviser a monthly advisory fee as full compensation for the services and facilities furnished to the Fund, and for Fund expenses assumed by the Adviser.\n\nThe fee is based on the Fund\u2019s daily net assets.\n\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Fund paid total investment advisory compensation (net of fee waivers, if applicable) amounting to 0.65% of the Fund\u2019s average daily net assets.\n\nMorgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., as the Adviser and the Administrator, has agreed to reduce its advisory fee, its administration fee and/or reimburse the Fund, if necessary, if such fees would cause the total annual operating expenses of the Fund to exceed 0.85% for Class IR.", "In determining the actual amount of fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement for the Fund, if any, the Adviser and the Administrator exclude from total annual operating expenses, acquired fund fees and expenses (as applicable), certain investment related expenses, taxes, interest and other extraordinary expenses (including litigation).\n\nThe fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of this Prospectus or until such time as the Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements when it deems such action is appropriate.\n\nThe Adviser and the Administrator may make additional voluntary fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements.\n\nThe Adviser and the Administrator may discontinue these voluntary fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements at any time in the future.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s annual operating expenses may vary throughout the period and from year to year.", "The Fund\u2019s

Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus | Shareholder Information\n\nShareholder Information\n\nPricing Fund Shares\n\nThe NAV of the Fund (excluding sales charges) is based on the value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities.\n\nWhile the assets of each class are invested in a single portfolio of securities, the NAV of each class will differ because the classes have different ongoing fees.\n\nThe NAV of the Fund is determined once daily on each business day as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) or such other times as the NYSE may officially close (the \u201cPricing Time\u201d).", "Shares generally will not be priced on days that the NYSE is closed.\n\nIf the NYSE is closed due to inclement weather, technology problems or any other reason on a day it would normally be open for business, or the NYSE has an unscheduled early closing on a day it has opened for business, the Fund reserves the right to treat such day as a business day and accept purchase and redemption orders until, and calculate its NAV as of, the normally scheduled close of regular trading on the NYSE for that day, so long as the Adviser believes there generally remains an adequate market to obtain reliable and accurate market quotations.\n\nThe Fund may elect to remain open and price its shares on days when the NYSE is closed but the primary securities markets on which the Fund\u2019s securities trade remain open.\n\nTrading of securities, which are traded on exchanges other than the NYSE, may take place on days when a Fund does not price its shares.", "Therefore, to the extent, if any, that a Fund invests in securities traded on other exchanges, the value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities may change on days when you will not be able to purchase or sell your shares.\n\nThe Fund relies on various sources to calculate its NAV.\n\nThe ability of the Fund\u2019s provider of administrative services to calculate the NAV per share of the Fund is subject to operational risks associated with processing or human errors, systems or technology failures, cyber attacks and errors caused by third party service providers, data sources, or trading counterparties.\n\nSuch failures may result in delays in the calculation of the Fund\u2019s NAV and/or the inability to calculate NAV over extended time periods.\n\nThe Fund may be unable to recover any losses associated with such failures.", "In addition, if the third party service providers and/or data sources upon which the Fund directly or indirectly relies to calculate its NAV or price individual securities are unavailable or otherwise unable to calculate the NAV correctly, it may be necessary for alternative procedures to be utilized to price the securities at the time of determining the Fund\u2019s NAV.\n\nThe value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities is based on the securities\u2019 market price when available.\n\nWhen no market quotations are readily available for a security or other asset, including circumstances under which the Adviser determines that a market quotation is not accurate, fair value for the security or other asset will be determined in good faith using methods approved by the Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees.", "In addition, with respect to securities that primarily are listed on foreign exchanges, when an event occurs after the close of such exchanges that is likely to have changed the value of the securities (e.g., a percentage change in value of one or more U.S. securities indices in excess of specified thresholds), such securities will be valued at their fair value, as determined in good faith using methods approved by the Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees.\n\nSecurities also may be fair valued in the event of a significant development affecting a country or region or an issuer-specific development that is likely to have changed the value of the security.\n\nIn these cases, the Fund\u2019s NAV will reflect certain portfolio securities\u2019 fair value rather than their market price.\n\nFair value pricing involves subjective judgments and it is possible that the fair value determined for a security or other asset is materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of that security or asset.", "To the extent the Fund invests in open-end management companies (other than exchange-traded funds) that are registered under the 1940 Act, the Fund\u2019s NAV is calculated based in relevant part upon the NAV of such funds.\n\nThe prospectuses for such funds explain the circumstances under which they will use their fair value pricing and its effects.\n\nContacting a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor If you are new to the Morgan Stanley Funds and would like to contact

subject to the shareholder services fee and other features applicable to such shares.\n\nConversion to another class of shares will result in holding a share class with higher fees.\n\nThe Fund will not convert to another class of shares based solely upon changes in the market that reduce the NAV of shares.\n\nUnder current tax law, conversion between share classes is not a taxable event to the

annually.\n\nCapital gains, if any, are usually distributed in December.\n\nThe Fund, however, may retain and reinvest any long-term capital gains.\n\nThe Fund may at times make payments from sources other than income or capital gains that represent a return of a portion of your investment.\n\nThese payments would not be taxable to you as a shareholder, but would have the effect of reducing your basis in the Fund.\n\nDistributions are reinvested automatically in additional shares of the same class and automatically credited to your account, unless you request in writing that all distributions be paid in cash.\n\nIf you elect the cash option, the Fund will mail a check to you no later than seven business days after the distribution is declared.", "However, if you purchase Fund shares through a Financial Intermediary within three business days prior to the record date for the distribution, the distribution will automatically be paid to you in cash, even if you did not request to receive all distributions in cash.\n\nNo interest will accrue on uncashed checks.\n\nIf you wish to change how your distributions are paid, your request should be received by the Transfer Agent at least five business days prior to the record date of the distributions.\n\nIf any distribution check remains uncashed for six months, Morgan Stanley reserves the right to invest the amount represented by the check in Fund shares at the then-current net asset value of the Fund and all future distributions will be reinvested.", "For accounts held directly with the Transfer Agent for which the shareholder has elected to receive distributions via check, any distribution (dividend or capital gain) under $10.00 is automatically reinvested in additional shares regardless of your elected

\u201cshort-term trading\u201d and may present risks for other shareholders of the Fund, which may include, among other things, dilution in the value of Fund shares held by long-term shareholders, interference with the efficient management of the Fund\u2019s portfolio, increased brokerage and administrative costs, incurring unwanted taxable gains and forcing the Fund to hold excess levels of cash.", "In addition, the Fund is subject to the risk that market-timers and/or short-term traders may take advantage of time zone differences between the foreign markets on which the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities trade and the time the Fund\u2019s NAV is calculated (\u201ctime-zone arbitrage\u201d).\n\nFor example, a market-timer may purchase shares of the Fund based on events occurring after foreign market closing prices are established, but before the Fund\u2019s NAV calculation, that are likely to result in higher prices in foreign markets the following day.\n\nThe market-timer would redeem the Fund\u2019s shares the next day, when the Fund\u2019s share price would reflect the increased prices in foreign markets, for a quick profit at the expense of long-term Fund shareholders.\n\nInvestments in other types of securities also may be susceptible to short-term trading strategies.", "These investments include securities that are, among other things, thinly traded, traded infrequently or relatively illiquid, which have the risk that the current market price for the securities may not accurately reflect current market values.\n\nA shareholder may seek to engage in short-term trading to take advantage of these pricing differences (referred to as \u201cprice arbitrage\u201d).\n\nInvestments in certain fixed-income securities may be adversely affected by price arbitrage trading strategies.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s policies with respect to valuing portfolio securities are described in \u201cShareholder Information\u2014Pricing Fund Shares.\u201d\n\nThe Fund discourages and does not accommodate frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares by Fund shareholders and the Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees has adopted policies and procedures with respect to such frequent purchases and redemptions.", "The Fund\u2019s policies with respect to purchases, redemptions and exchanges of Fund shares are described in the \u201cShareholder Information\u2014How to

written approval only, a Financial Intermediary\u2019s own policies) with respect to frequent purchases, redemptions and exchanges of Fund shares.\n\nOmnibus accounts generally do not identify customers\u2019 trading activity to the Fund on an individual ongoing basis.\n\nTherefore, with respect to trades that occur through omnibus accounts at Financial Intermediaries, to some extent, the Fund relies on the Financial Intermediary to monitor frequent short-term trading within the Fund by the Financial Intermediary\u2019s customers.", "However, the Fund or the Distributor has entered

transferred to the relevant state (also known as \u201cescheatment\u201d) under various circumstances.\n\nThese circumstances, which vary by state, can include inactivity (e.g., no owner-initiated contact for a certain period), returned mail (e.g., when mail sent to a shareholder is returned by the post office as undeliverable), uncashed checks or a combination of these.", "An incorrect address may cause a shareholder\u2019s account statements and other mailings to be returned to the Fund or your Financial Intermediary.\n\nSince states\u2019 statutory requirements regarding inactivity differ, it is important to regularly contact your Financial Intermediary or the Fund\u2019s transfer agent.\n\nThe process described above, and the application of state escheatment laws, may vary by state and/or depending on how shareholders hold their shares in the Fund.\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that you maintain a valid mailing address for your account, keep your account active by contacting your Financial Intermediary or the Fund\u2019s transfer agent (e.g., by mail or telephone), and promptly cash all checks for dividends, capital gains and redemptions.\n\nNeither the Fund

1099-DIV) by February of each year showing the taxable distributions paid to you in the previous year.", "The statement provides information on your dividends and any capital gains for tax purposes.\n\nYour sale of Fund shares normally is subject to federal and state income tax and may result in a taxable gain or loss to you.\n\nA sale also may be subject to local income tax.\n\nYour exchange of Fund shares for shares of another Morgan Stanley Fund is treated for tax purposes like a sale of your original shares and a purchase of your new shares.\n\nThus, the exchange may, like a sale, result in a taxable gain or loss to you and will give you a new tax basis for your new shares.", "An additional 3.8% Medicare tax is imposed on certain net investment income (including ordinary dividends and capital gain distributions received from the Fund and net gains from redemptions or other taxable dispositions of Fund shares) of U.S. individuals, estates and trusts to the extent that such person\u2019s \u201cmodified adjusted gross income\u201d (in the case of an individual) or \u201cadjusted gross income\u201d (in the case of an estate or trust) exceeds certain threshold amounts.\n\nShareholders who are not citizens or residents of the United States and certain foreign entities will generally be subject to withholding of U.S. tax of 30% on distributions made by the Fund of investment income.", "Dividends paid by the Fund to shareholders who are nonresident aliens or foreign entities that are derived from short-term capital gains and qualifying U.S. source net interest income (including income from original issue discount and market discount), and that are reported by the Fund as \u201cinterest-related dividends\u201d or \u201cshort-term capital gain dividends,\u201d will generally not be subject to U.S. withholding tax, provided that the income would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if earned directly by the foreign shareholder.\n\nHowever, depending on the circumstances, the Fund may report all, some or none of the Fund\u2019s potentially eligible dividends as exempt.\n\nThe Fund is required to withhold U.S. tax (at a 30% rate) on payments of taxable dividends made to certain non-U.S. entities that fail to comply (or be deemed compliant) with extensive reporting and withholding requirements designed to inform the U.S. Department of the Treasury of U.S.-owned foreign investment accounts.", "Shareholders may be requested to provide additional information to the Fund to enable the Fund to determine whether withholding is required.\n\nThe Fund (or its administrative agent) is required to report to the IRS and furnish to Fund shareholders the cost basis information for sale transactions of shares purchased on or after January 1, 2012.\n\nShareholders may elect to have one of several cost basis methods applied to their account when calculating the cost basis of shares sold, including average cost, FIFO (\u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d) or some other specific identification method.\n\nUnless you instruct otherwise, the Fund will use average cost as its default cost basis method, and will treat sales as first coming from shares purchased prior to January 1, 2012.\n\nIf average cost is used for the first sale of Fund shares covered by these new rules, the shareholder may only use an alternative cost basis method for shares purchased prospectively.", "Fund shareholders should consult with their tax advisors to determine the best cost basis method for their tax situation.\n\nWhen you open your Fund account, you should provide your social security or tax identification number on your investment application.\n\nBy providing this information, you will avoid being subject to federal backup withholding tax on taxable distributions and redemption proceeds at a rate of 24%.\n\nAny withheld amount would be sent to the IRS as an advance payment of your taxes due on your income.\n\nShare Class Arrangements\n\nThe Fund offers several classes of shares having different distribution arrangements designed to provide you with different purchase options according to your investment needs.\n\nYour Financial Intermediary can help you decide which class may be appropriate for you.\n\nThis Prospectus offers Class IR shares of the Fund.\n\nThe Fund also offers Class A, Class L, Class I, Class C and Class R6 shares through a separate prospectus.", "The Class L shares of the Fund are currently closed to all investors except in the limited circumstances set forth in such prospectus.\n\nIn addition, the Adviser may in its sole discretion permit a conversion of one share class to another share class of the Fund in certain circumstances, provided that the Fund\u2019s eligibility requirements are met, and subject to the shareholder\u2019s consent.\n\nSuch conversions will be on the basis of the relative NAVs and without the imposition of any redemption fee or other charge.\n\nA conversion of shares of one class directly for shares of another class of the Fund normally should not be taxable for federal income tax purposes.\n\nPlease ask your financial advisor if you are eligible for converting a class of shares pursuant to this conversion feature.\n\nYou should talk to your tax advisor before making a conversion.\n\nCLASS IR SHARES Class IR shares are offered at NAV without any sales charge on purchases or sales.", "In addition, no distribution (12b-1) or shareholder services fees, sub-accounting or other similar fees, or any finder\u2019s fee payments are charged or paid on Class IR shares.\n\nTo purchase Class IR shares, an investor must meet a minimum initial investment of $5 million or be a defined contribution, defined benefit or other employer sponsored employee benefit plan, in each case provided that the plan trades on an omnibus level,\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus  |  Shareholder Information\n\nShareholder Information (Con\u2019t)\n\nwhether or not qualified under the Code and in each case subject to the discretion of the Adviser.\n\nOmnibus trades of $5 million or more shall be accepted from certain platforms, including; (i) banks and trust companies; (ii) insurance companies; and (iii) registered investment advisory firms.", "The $5 million minimum initial investment amount may be waived for Fund shares purchased by or through: (1) certain registered open-end investment companies whose shares are distributed by the Distributor; or (2) investments made in connection with certain mergers and/or reorganizations as approved by the Adviser.\n\nPotential Conflicts of Interest\n\nAs a diversified global financial services firm, Morgan Stanley, the parent company of the Adviser, engages in a broad spectrum of activities, including financial advisory services, investment management activities, lending, commercial banking, sponsoring and managing private investment funds, engaging in broker-dealer transactions and principal securities, commodities and foreign exchange transactions, research publication and other activities.", "In the ordinary course of its business, Morgan Stanley is a full-service investment banking and financial services firm and therefore engages in activities where Morgan Stanley\u2019s interests or the interests of its clients may conflict with the interests of the Fund.\n\nMorgan Stanley advises clients and sponsors, manages or advises other investment funds and investment programs, accounts and businesses (collectively, together with any new or successor funds, programs, accounts or businesses, the \u2018\u2018Affiliated Investment Accounts\u2019\u2019) with a wide variety of investment objectives that in some instances may overlap or conflict with the Fund\u2019s investment objectives and present conflicts of interest.\n\nIn addition, Morgan Stanley may also from time to time create new or successor Affiliated Investment Accounts that may compete with the Fund and present similar conflicts of interest.\n\nThe discussion below enumerates certain actual, apparent and potential conflicts of interest.", "There is no assurance that conflicts of interest will be resolved in favor of Fund shareholders and, in fact, they may not be.\n\nConflicts of interest not described below may also exist.\n\nFor more information about conflicts of interest, see the section entitled \u201cPotential Conflicts of Interest\u201d in the SAI.\n\nMaterial Nonpublic Information.\n\nIt is expected that confidential or material nonpublic information regarding an investment or potential investment opportunity may become available to the Adviser.\n\nIf such information becomes available, the Adviser may be precluded (including by applicable law or internal policies or procedures) from pursuing an investment or disposition opportunity with respect to such investment or investment opportunity.\n\nMorgan Stanley has established certain information barriers and other policies to address the sharing of information between different businesses within Morgan Stanley.", "In limited circumstances, however, including for purposes of managing business and reputational risk, and subject to policies and procedures and any applicable regulations, personnel, including personnel of the investment adviser, on one side of an information barrier may have access to information and personnel on the other side of the information barrier through \u201cwall crossings.\u201d\n\nThe Adviser faces conflicts of interest in determining whether to engage in such wall crossings.\n\nInformation obtained in connection with such wall crossings may limit or restrict the ability of the Adviser to engage in or otherwise effect transactions on behalf of the Fund (including purchasing or selling securities that the Adviser may otherwise have purchased or sold for the Fund in the absence of a wall crossing).\n\nInvestments by Morgan Stanley and its Affiliated Investment Accounts.", "In serving in multiple capacities to Affiliated Investment Accounts, Morgan Stanley, including the Adviser and the Investment team, may have obligations to other clients or investors in Affiliated Investment Accounts, the fulfillment of which may not be in the best interests of the Fund or its shareholders.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s investment objectives may overlap with the investment objectives of certain Affiliated Investment Accounts.\n\nAs a result, the members of an Investment team may face conflicts in the allocation of investment opportunities among the Fund and other investment funds, programs, accounts and businesses advised by or affiliated with the Adviser.\n\nCertain Affiliated Investment Accounts may provide for higher management or incentive fees or greater expense reimbursements or overhead allocations, all of which may contribute to this conflict of interest and create an incentive for the Adviser to favor such other accounts.", "To seek to reduce potential conflicts of interest and to attempt to allocate such investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, the Adviser has implemented allocation policies and procedures.\n\nThese policies and procedures are intended to give all clients of the Adviser, including the Fund, fair access to investment opportunities consistent with the requirements of organizational documents, investment strategies, applicable laws and regulations, and the fiduciary duties of the Adviser.\n\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries.\n\nThe Adviser and/or the Distributor may pay compensation, out of their own funds and not as an expense of the Fund, to certain Financial Intermediaries (which may include affiliates of the Adviser and Distributor), including recordkeepers and administrators of various deferred compensation plans, in connection with the sale, distribution, marketing and retention of shares of the Fund and/or shareholder servicing.", "The prospect of receiving, or the receipt of, additional compensation, as described above, by Financial Intermediaries may provide such Financial Intermediaries and their financial advisors and other salespersons with an incentive to favor sales of shares of the Fund over other investment options with respect to which these Financial Intermediaries do not receive additional compensation (or receives lower levels of additional compensation).\n\nThese payment arrangements, however, will not change the price that an investor pays for shares of the Fund or the amount that the Fund receives to invest on behalf of an investor.\n\nInvestors may wish to take such payment arrangements into account when considering and evaluating any recommendations relating to Fund shares and should review carefully any disclosures provided by Financial Intermediaries as to their compensation.", "In addition, in certain circumstances, the Adviser restricts, limits or reduces the amount of the Fund\u2019s investment, or restricts the type of governance or voting rights it acquires or exercises, where the Fund\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus | Shareholder Information\n\nShareholder Information (Con\u2019t)\n\n(potentially together with Morgan Stanley) exceeds a certain ownership interest, or possesses certain degrees of voting or control or has other interests.\n\nMorgan Stanley Trading and Principal Investing Activities.", "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Morgan Stanley will generally conduct its sales and trading businesses, publish research and analysis, and render investment advice without regard for the Fund\u2019s holdings, although these activities could have an adverse impact on the value of one or more of the Fund\u2019s investments, or could cause Morgan Stanley to have an interest in one or more portfolio investments that is different from, and potentially adverse to, that of the Fund.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Investment Banking and Other Commercial Activities.\n\nMorgan Stanley advises clients on a variety of mergers, acquisitions, restructuring, bankruptcy and financing transactions.\n\nMorgan Stanley may act as an advisor to clients, including other investment funds that may compete with the Fund and with respect to investments that the Fund may hold.", "Morgan Stanley may give advice and take action with respect to any of its clients or proprietary accounts that may differ from the advice given, or may involve an action of a different timing or nature than the action taken, by the Fund.\n\nMorgan Stanley may give advice and provide recommendations to persons competing with the Fund and/or any of the Fund\u2019s investments that are contrary to the Fund\u2019s best interests and/or the best interests of any of its investments.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s activities on behalf of its clients (such as engagements as an underwriter or placement agent) may restrict or otherwise limit investment opportunities that may otherwise be available to the Fund.", "Morgan Stanley may be engaged to act as a financial advisor to a company in connection with the sale of such company, or subsidiaries or divisions thereof, may represent potential buyers of businesses through its mergers and acquisition activities and may provide lending and other related financing services in connection with such transactions.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s compensation for such activities is usually based upon realized consideration and is usually contingent, in substantial part, upon the closing of the transaction.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Fund may be precluded from participating in a transaction with or relating to the company being sold or participating in any financing activity related to a merger or an acquisition.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nMorgan Stanley Prospectus  |  Consolidated Financial Highlights\n\nConsolidated Financial Highlights", "The consolidated financial highlights table is intended to help you understand the financial performance of the Class IR shares of the Fund since inception.\n\nCertain information reflects financial results for a single Fund share.\n\nThe total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor would have earned (or lost) on an investment in the Fund (assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions).\n\nThe ratio of expenses to average net assets listed in the table below for Class IR shares of the Fund are based on the average net assets of the Fund for each of the periods listed in the table.\n\nTo the extent that the Fund\u2019s average net assets decrease over the Fund\u2019s next fiscal year, such expense

an ownership interest in an issuer, or may be convertible into or represent a right to acquire an ownership interest in an issuer.\n\nWhile there are many types of equity securities, prices of all equity securities will fluctuate.\n\nEconomic, political and other events may affect the prices of broad equity markets.", "For example, changes in inflation or consumer demand may affect the prices of equity securities generally in the United States.\n\nSimilar events also may affect the prices of particular equity securities.\n\nFor example, news about the success or failure of a new product may affect the price of a particular issuer\u2019s equity securities.\n\nCommon Stocks.\n\nCommon stocks are equity securities representing an ownership interest in a corporation, entitling the stockholder to voting rights and receipt of dividends paid based on proportionate ownership.\n\nPreferred Stocks.\n\nPreferred stocks are securities that evidence ownership in a corporation and pay a fixed or variable stream of dividends.\n\nPreferred stocks have a preference over common stocks in the event of the liquidation of an issuer and usually do not carry voting rights.\n\nPreferred stocks have many of the characteristics of both equity securities and fixed-income securities.\n\nMoney Market Instruments.", "Money market instruments are high quality short-term fixed-income securities.\n\nMoney market instruments may include obligations of governments, government agencies, banks, corporations and special purpose entities and repurchase agreements relating to these obligations.\n\nCertain money market instruments may be denominated in a foreign currency.\n\nCash Equivalents.\n\nCash equivalents are short-term fixed-income securities comprising:\n\n\u25a0 |  Time deposits, certificates of deposit (including marketable variable rate certificates of deposit) and bankers\u2019 acceptances issued by a commercial bank or savings and loan association.\n\nTime deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained in a banking institution for a specified period of time at a stated interest rate.\n\nCertificates of deposit are negotiable short-term obligations issued by commercial banks or savings and loan associations against funds deposited in the issuing institution.", "Variable rate certificates of deposit are certificates of deposit on which the interest rate is periodically adjusted prior to their stated maturity based upon a specified market rate.\n\nA bankers\u2019 acceptance is a time draft drawn on a commercial bank by a borrower, usually in connection with an international commercial transaction (to finance the import, export, transfer or storage of goods);\n\n\u25a0 |  Obligations of U.S. banks, foreign branches of U.S. banks (Eurodollars) and U.S. branches of foreign banks (Yankee dollars).\n\nEurodollar and Yankee dollar investments will involve some of the same risks of investing in international securities that are discussed in various foreign investing sections of this SAI;", "\u25a0 |  Any security issued by a commercial bank if (i) the bank has total assets of at least $1 billion, or the equivalent in other currencies or, in the case of domestic banks which do not have total assets of at least $1 billion, the aggregate investment made in any one such bank is limited to $250,000 principal amount per certificate and the principal amount of such investment is insured in full by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d), (ii) in the case of U.S. banks, it is a member of the FDIC and (iii) in the case of foreign branches of U.S. banks, the security is deemed by the Adviser to be of an investment quality comparable with other debt securities which the Fund may purchase;\n\n\u25a0 |  Commercial paper rated at time of purchase by one or more nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (\u201cNRSROs\u201d) in one of their two highest categories (e.g., A-l or A-2 by S&P Global Inc. (\u201cS&P\u201d), Prime 1 or Prime 2 by Moody\u2019s Investors\n\nBack to Table of Contents", "|  Service, Inc. (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) or F1 or F2 by Fitch Ratings, Inc. (\u201cFitch\u201d)) or, if unrated, determined to be of comparable quality by the Adviser;\n\n\u25a0 |  Short-term corporate obligations rated high-grade at the time of purchase by an NRSRO (e.g., A or better by Moody\u2019s, S&P or Fitch);\n\n\u25a0 |  U.S. government obligations, including bills, notes, bonds and other debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThese are direct obligations of the U.S. Government and differ mainly in interest rates, maturities and dates of issue;\n\n\u25a0 |  Government agency securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. government sponsored instrumentalities and Federal agencies.\n\nThese include securities issued by the Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal Land Bank, Farmers Home Administration, Farm Credit Banks, Federal Intermediate Credit Bank, Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d), Federal Financing Bank, the Tennessee Valley Authority (\u201cTVA\u201d) and others; and", "\u25a0 |  Repurchase agreements collateralized by the securities listed above.\n\nRepurchase Agreements.\n\nRepurchase agreements are transactions in which the Fund purchases a security or basket of securities and simultaneously commits to resell that security or basket to the seller (a bank, broker or dealer) at a mutually agreed-upon date and price.\n\nThe resale price reflects the purchase price plus an agreed-upon market rate of interest which is unrelated to the coupon rate or date of maturity of the purchased security.\n\nThe term of these agreements usually ranges from overnight to one week, and never exceeds one year.\n\nRepurchase agreements with a term of over seven days are considered illiquid.\n\nIn these transactions, the Fund receives securities that have a market value at least equal to the purchase price (including accrued interest) of the repurchase agreement, and this value is maintained during the term of the agreement.", "These securities are held by the Fund\u2019s custodian or an approved third-party for the benefit of the Fund until repurchased.\n\nRepurchase agreements permit the Fund to remain fully invested while retaining overnight flexibility to pursue investments of a longer-term nature.\n\nIf the seller defaults and the value of the repurchased securities declines, the Fund might incur a loss.\n\nIf bankruptcy proceedings are commenced with respect to the seller, the Fund\u2019s realization upon the collateral may be delayed.\n\nWhile repurchase agreements involve certain risks not associated with direct investments in debt securities, the Fund follows procedures approved by the Trustees that are designed to minimize such risks.\n\nThese procedures include effecting repurchase transactions only with large, well-capitalized and well-established financial institutions whose financial condition will be continually monitored by the Adviser.", "In addition, as described above, the value of the collateral underlying the repurchase agreement will be at least equal to the repurchase price, including any accrued interest earned on the repurchase agreement.\n\nIn the event of a default or bankruptcy by a selling financial institution, the Fund will seek to liquidate such collateral.\n\nHowever, the exercising of the Fund\u2019s right to liquidate such collateral could involve certain costs or delays and, to the extent that proceeds from any sale upon a default of the obligation to repurchase were less than the repurchase price, the Fund could suffer a loss.\n\nIt is the current policy of the Fund not to invest in repurchase agreements that do not mature within seven days if any such investment, together with any other illiquid assets held by the Fund, amounts to more than 15% of its net assets.\n\nTemporary Defensive Investments.", "When the Adviser believes that changes in market, economic, political or other conditions make it advisable, the Fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in cash, cash equivalents and other fixed-income securities for temporary defensive purposes that may be inconsistent with the Fund\u2019s investment strategies.\n\nThese temporary investments may consist of obligations of the U.S. or foreign governments, their agencies and instrumentalities; money market instruments; and instruments issued by international development agencies.\n\nZero Coupons.\n\nZero coupons are fixed-income securities on which the holder does not receive periodic cash payments of interest or principal.\n\nGenerally, these securities are subject to greater price volatility and lesser liquidity in the event of adverse market conditions than comparably rated securities paying cash interest at regular intervals.", "Although the Fund will not receive cash periodic coupon payments on these securities, the Fund may be deemed to have received interest income, or \u201cphantom income\u201d during the life of the obligation.\n\nThe Fund may have to distribute such phantom income to avoid taxes at the Fund level, although it has not received any cash payment.\n\nZero coupons are sold at a discount from their face value.\n\nThe difference between a zero coupon\u2019s issue or purchase price and its face value represents the imputed interest an investor will earn if the obligation is held until maturity.\n\nFor tax purposes, a portion of this imputed interest is deemed as income received by zero coupon bondholders each year.\n\nThe Fund intends to pass along such interest as a component of the Fund\u2019s distributions of net investment income.\n\nZero coupons may offer investors the opportunity to earn a higher yield than that available on ordinary interest-paying obligations of similar credit quality and maturity.", "However, zero coupon prices may also exhibit greater price volatility than ordinary fixed-income securities because of the manner in which their principal and interest are returned to the investor.\n\nReal Estate Investment Trusts and Foreign Real Estate Companies.\n\nThe Fund may invest in real estate investment trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d) and/or foreign real estate companies, which are similar to entities organized and operated as REITs in the United States.\n\nREITs and foreign real estate companies pool investors\u2019 funds for investment primarily in real estate properties or real estate-related loans.\n\nREITs and foreign real estate companies generally derive their income from rents on the underlying properties or interest on\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nthe underlying loans, and their value is impacted by changes in the value of the underlying property or changes in interest rates affecting the underlying loans owned by the REITs and/or foreign real estate companies.", "REITs and foreign real estate companies are more susceptible to risks associated with the ownership of real estate and the real estate industry in general.\n\nThese risks can include fluctuations in the value of underlying properties; defaults by borrowers or tenants; market saturation; changes in general and local economic conditions; decreases in market rates for rents; increases in competition, property taxes, capital expenditures or operating expenses; and other economic, political or regulatory occurrences affecting the real estate industry.", "In addition, REITs and foreign real estate companies depend upon specialized management skills, may not be diversified (which may increase the volatility of a REIT\u2019s and/or foreign real estate company\u2019s value), may have less trading volume, may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than the overall securities market, are dependent on heavy cash flows, subject to risks associated with default by borrowers or self-liquidation, and the possibility of failing to maintain their exemptions from the 1940 Act.\n\nForeign real estate companies may be subject to laws, rules and regulations governing those entities and their failure to comply with those laws, rules and regulations could negatively impact the performance of those entities.\n\nOperating REITs and foreign real estate companies requires specialized management skills and the Fund indirectly bears REIT and foreign real estate company management expenses along with the direct expenses of the Fund.", "REITs are generally not taxed on income distributed to shareholders provided they comply with several requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\n\nREITs are subject to the risk of failing to qualify for tax-free pass-through income under the Code.\n\nSector Risk.\n\nThe Fund may, from time to time, invest more heavily in companies in a particular economic sector or sectors.\n\nEconomic or regulatory changes adversely affecting such sectors may have more of an impact on the Fund\u2019s performance than if the Fund held a broader range of investments.\n\nLoans of Portfolio Securities.\n\nThe Fund may lend its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers, banks and other institutional investors.\n\nBy lending its portfolio securities, the Fund attempts to increase its net investment income through the receipt of interest on the cash collateral with respect to the loan or fees received from the borrower in connection with the loan.", "Any gain or loss in the market price of the securities loaned that might occur during the term of the loan would be for the account of the Fund.\n\nThe Fund employs an agent to implement the securities lending program and the agent receives a fee from the Fund for its services.\n\nThe Fund will not lend more than 33\u2153% of the value of its total assets.", "The Fund may lend its portfolio securities so long as the terms, structure and the aggregate amount of such loans are not inconsistent with the 1940 Act or the rules and regulations or interpretations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) thereunder, which currently require that (i) the borrower pledge and maintain with the Fund collateral consisting of liquid, unencumbered assets having a value not less than 100% of the value of the securities loaned; (ii) the borrower adds to such collateral whenever the price of the securities loaned rises (i.e., the borrower \u201cmarks-to-market\u201d on a daily basis); (iii) the loan be made subject to termination by the Fund at any time; and (iv) the Fund receives a reasonable return on the loan (which may include the Fund investing any cash collateral in interest bearing short-term investments), any distributions on the loaned securities and any increase in their market value.", "In addition, voting rights may pass with the loaned securities, but the Fund will retain the right to call any security in anticipation of a vote that the Adviser deems material to the security on loan.\n\nLoans of securities involve a risk that the borrower may fail to return the securities or may fail to maintain the proper amount of collateral, which may result in a loss of money by the Fund.\n\nThere may be risks of delay and costs involved in recovery of securities or even loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially.\n\nThese delays and costs could be greater for foreign securities.\n\nHowever, loans will be made only to borrowers deemed by the Adviser to be creditworthy and when, in the judgment of the Adviser, the income that can be earned from such securities loans justifies the attendant risk.", "All relevant facts and circumstances, including the creditworthiness of the broker, dealer, bank or institution, will be considered in making decisions with respect to the lending of securities, subject to review by the Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees.\n\nThe Fund also bears the risk that the reinvestment of collateral will result in a principal loss.\n\nFinally, there is the risk that the price of the securities will increase while they are on loan and the collateral will not be adequate to cover their value.\n\nBorrowing.\n\nThe Fund has an operating policy, which may be changed by the Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees, not to borrow except from a bank for temporary or emergency purposes in amounts not exceeding 5% (taken at the lower of cost or current value) of its total assets (not including the amount borrowed).", "Should the Board of Trustees remove this operating policy, the Fund would be permitted to borrow money from banks in accordance with the 1940 Act or the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder.\n\nCurrently, the 1940 Act permits a fund to borrow money from banks in an amount up to 331/3% of its total assets (including the amount borrowed) less its liabilities not represented by senior securities.\n\nThe Fund may also borrow an additional 5% of its total assets without regard to the foregoing limitation for temporary purposes such as clearance of portfolio transactions.\n\nThe Fund will only borrow when the Adviser believes that such borrowings will benefit the Fund after taking into account considerations such as interest income and possible gains or losses upon liquidation.\n\nThe Fund will maintain asset coverage in accordance with the 1940 Act.\n\nBorrowing by the Fund creates an opportunity for increased net income but, at the same time, creates special risks.", "For example, leveraging may exaggerate changes in and increase the volatility of the NAV of the Fund.\n\nThis is because leverage tends to exaggerate\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nthe effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities.\n\nThe use of leverage also may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so in order to satisfy its obligations or to maintain asset coverage.", "In general, the Fund may not issue any class of senior security, except that the Fund may (i) borrow from banks, provided that immediately following any such borrowing there is an asset coverage of at least 300% for all Fund borrowings and in the event such asset coverage falls below 300% the Fund will within three days or such longer period as the SEC may prescribe by rules and regulations, reduce the amount of its borrowings to an extent that the asset coverage of such borrowings shall be at least 300%, and (ii) engage in trading practices that could be deemed to involve the issuance of a senior security, including but not limited to options, futures, forward contracts and reverse repurchase agreements in accordance with applicable SEC requirements.", "The borrowings subject to these limits include borrowings through reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions unless the Fund has elected to treat all such transactions as derivatives transactions under applicable SEC requirements.\n\nWhen-Issued and Delayed Delivery Securities, TBAs and Forward Commitments.\n\nThe Fund may purchase or sell securities on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis or may purchase or sell securities on a forward commitment basis.\n\nWhen these transactions are negotiated, the price is fixed at the time of the commitment, but delivery and payment can take place a month or more after the date of commitment.\n\nThe Fund may sell the securities before the settlement date if it is deemed advisable.\n\nThe securities so purchased or sold are subject to market fluctuation and no interest or dividends accrue to the purchaser prior to the settlement date.", "In addition, the Fund may invest in to-be-announced pass-through mortgage securities, which settle on a delayed delivery basis (\u201cTBAs\u201d).\n\nIn a TBA transaction, the buyer and seller agree upon general trade parameters such as agency, settlement date, par amount, and price at the time the contract is entered into but the MBS are delivered in the future, generally 30 days later.\n\nAccordingly, the Fund\u2019s investments in TBAs are subject to risks such as failure of the counterparty to perform its obligation to deliver the security, the characteristics of a security delivered to the Fund may be less favorable than expected and the security the Fund buys will lose value prior to its delivery.\n\nAt the time the Fund makes the commitment to purchase or sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis, it will record the transaction and thereafter reflect the value, each day, of such security purchased, or if a sale, the proceeds to be received, in determining its NAV.", "At the time of delivery of the securities, their value may be more or less than the purchase or sale price.\n\nAn increase in the percentage of the Fund\u2019s assets committed to the purchase of securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis may increase the volatility of its NAV.\n\nWhen, As and If Issued Securities.\n\nThe Fund may purchase securities on a \u201cwhen, as and if issued\u201d basis, under which the issuance of the security depends upon the occurrence of a subsequent event, such as approval of a merger, corporate reorganization or debt restructuring.\n\nThe commitment for the purchase of any such security will not be recognized in the portfolio of the Fund until the Adviser determines that issuance of the security is probable.\n\nAt that time, the Fund will record the transaction and, in determining its NAV, will reflect the value of the security daily.", "An increase in the percentage of the Fund\u2019s assets committed to the purchase of securities on a \u201cwhen, as and if issued\u201d basis may increase the volatility of its NAV.\n\nThe Fund may also sell securities on a \u201cwhen, as and if issued\u201d basis provided that the issuance of the security will result automatically from the exchange or conversion of a security owned by the Fund at the time of sale.\n\nNon-Publicly Traded Securities, Private Placements and Restricted Securities.\n\nThe Fund may invest in securities that are neither listed on a stock exchange nor traded OTC, including privately placed and restricted securities.\n\nSuch unlisted securities may involve a higher degree of business and financial risk that can result in substantial losses.\n\nAs a result of the absence of a public trading market for these securities, they may be less liquid than publicly traded securities.", "Although these securities may be resold in privately negotiated transactions, the prices realized from these sales could be less than those originally paid by the Fund or less than what may be considered the fair value of such securities.\n\nFurthermore, companies whose securities are not publicly traded may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements which might be applicable if their securities were publicly traded.\n\nThe illiquidity of the market, as well as the lack of publicly available information regarding these securities, may also adversely affect the ability of the Fund to arrive at a fair value for certain securities at certain times and could make it difficult for the Fund to sell certain securities.\n\nIf such securities are required to be registered under the securities laws of one or more jurisdictions before being sold, the Fund may be required to bear the expenses of registration.", "The Fund may purchase equity securities, in a private placement, that are issued by issuers who have outstanding, publicly-traded equity securities of the same class (\u201cprivate investments in public equity\u201d or \u201cPIPEs\u201d).\n\nShares in PIPEs generally are not registered with the SEC until after a certain time period from the date the private sale is completed.\n\nThis restricted period can last many months.\n\nUntil the public registration process is completed, PIPEs are restricted as to resale and the Fund cannot freely trade the securities.\n\nGenerally, such restrictions cause the PIPEs to be illiquid during this time.\n\nPIPEs may contain provisions that the issuer will pay specified financial penalties to the holder if the issuer does not publicly register the restricted equity securities within a specified period of time, but there is no assurance that the restricted equity securities will be publicly registered, or that the registration will remain in effect.\n\nBack to Table of Contents", "Limited Partnership and Limited Liability Company Interests.\n\nA limited partnership interest entitles the Fund to participate in the investment return of the partnership\u2019s assets as defined by the agreement among the partners.\n\nAs a limited partner, the Fund generally is not permitted to participate in the management of the partnership.\n\nHowever, unlike a general partner whose liability is not limited, a limited partner\u2019s liability generally is limited to the amount of its commitment to the partnership.\n\nThe Fund may invest in limited liability company interests to the same extent it invests in limited partnership interests.\n\nLimited liability company interests have similar characteristics as limited partnership interests.\n\nConvertible Securities.", "A convertible security is a bond, debenture, note, preferred stock, right, warrant or other security that may be converted into or exchanged for a prescribed amount of common stock or other security of the same or a different issuer or into cash within a particular period of time at a specified price or formula.\n\nA convertible security generally entitles the holder to receive interest paid or accrued on debt securities or the dividend paid on preferred stock until the convertible security matures or is redeemed, converted or exchanged.\n\nBefore conversion, convertible securities generally have characteristics similar to both debt and equity securities.\n\nThe value of convertible securities tends to decline as interest rates rise and, because of the conversion feature, tends to vary with fluctuations in the market value of the underlying securities.\n\nConvertible securities ordinarily provide a stream of income with generally higher yields than those of common stock of the same or similar issuers.", "Convertible securities generally rank senior to common stock in a corporation\u2019s capital structure but are usually subordinated to comparable nonconvertible fixed-income securities in such capital structure.\n\nConvertible securities generally do not participate directly in any dividend increases or decreases of the underlying securities although the market prices of convertible securities may be affected by any dividend changes or other changes in the underlying securities.\n\nUp to 5% of the Fund\u2019s net assets may be invested in convertible securities and other fixed-income securities that are below investment grade.\n\nThe prices of such securities are likely to be more sensitive to adverse economic changes than higher-rated securities, resulting in increased volatility of market prices of these securities during periods of economic uncertainty, or adverse individual corporate developments.", "In addition, during an economic downturn or substantial period of rising interest rates, lower rated issuers may experience financial stress.\n\nForeign Securities.\n\nInvesting in foreign securities involves certain special considerations which are not typically associated with investments in the securities of U.S. issuers.\n\nForeign issuers are not generally subject to uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and may have policies that are not comparable to those of domestic issuers.\n\nAs a result, there may be less information available about foreign issuers than about domestic issuers.\n\nSecurities of some foreign issuers may be less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable domestic issuers.\n\nThere is generally less stringent investor protections and disclosure standards, and less government supervision and regulation of stock exchanges, brokers and listed issuers than in the United States.", "In addition, with respect to certain foreign countries, there is a possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation, political and social instability, or diplomatic developments which could affect U.S. investments in those countries.\n\nThe costs of investing in foreign countries frequently are higher than the costs of investing in the United States.\n\nAlthough the Adviser endeavors to achieve the most favorable execution costs in portfolio transactions, fixed commissions on many foreign stock exchanges are generally higher than negotiated commissions on U.S. exchanges.\n\nPursuant to regulatory changes effective in May 2024, many U.S., Canadian, and Mexican securities transitioned to a \u201cT+1\u201d (trade date plus one day) settlement cycle, while securities trading in most other markets typically have longer settlement cycles.\n\nAs a result, there can be potential operational, settlement and other risks for the Funds associated with differences in settlement cycles between markets.", "In addition, investments in certain foreign markets that have historically been considered stable may become more volatile and subject to increased risk due to ongoing developments and changing conditions in such markets.\n\nMoreover, the growing interconnectivity of global economies and financial markets has increased the probability that adverse developments and conditions in one country or region will affect the stability of economies and financial markets in other countries or regions.\n\nFor instance, if one or more countries leave the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) or the EU dissolves, the world\u2019s securities markets likely will be significantly disrupted.\n\nInvestments in foreign markets may also be adversely affected by governmental actions such as the imposition of capital controls, nationalization of companies or industries, expropriation of assets or the imposition of punitive taxes.", "The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investing in their capital markets or in certain sectors or industries.\n\nIn addition, a foreign government may limit or cause delay in the convertibility or repatriation of its currency which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value and/or liquidity of investments denominated in that currency.\n\nCertain foreign investments may become less liquid in response to market developments or adverse investor perceptions, or become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil.\n\nWhen the Fund holds illiquid investments, its portfolio may be harder to value.\n\nInvestments in securities of foreign issuers may be denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nAccordingly, the value of the Fund\u2019s assets, as measured in U.S. dollars, may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in currency exchange rates and in exchange control regulations.", "The Fund may incur costs in connection with conversions between various currencies.\n\nCertain foreign markets may rely heavily on particular industries or foreign capital and are more vulnerable to diplomatic developments, wars, the imposition of economic sanctions against a particular country or countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals, changes in international trading patterns, trade barriers, and other protectionist or retaliatory measures.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nInternational trade barriers or economic sanctions against foreign countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals, may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s foreign holdings or exposures.\n\nInvestments in foreign markets may also be adversely affected by governmental actions such as the imposition of capital controls, nationalization of companies or industries, expropriation of assets, or the imposition of punitive taxes.", "Governmental actions can have a significant effect on the economic conditions in foreign countries, which also may adversely affect the value and liquidity of the Fund\u2019s investments.\n\nFor example, the governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investing in their capital markets or in certain sectors or industries.\n\nIn addition, a foreign government may limit or cause delay in the convertibility or repatriation of its currency which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value and/or liquidity of investments denominated in that currency.\n\nAny of these actions could severely affect security prices, impair the Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or sell foreign securities or transfer the Fund\u2019s assets back into the U.S., or otherwise adversely affect the Fund\u2019s operations.", "Certain foreign investments may become less liquid in response to market developments or adverse investor perceptions, or become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil.\n\nCertain foreign investments may become illiquid when, for instance, there are few, if any, interested buyers and sellers or when dealers are unwilling to make a market for certain securities.\n\nWhen the Fund holds illiquid investments, its portfolio may be harder to value.\n\nThe U.S. and governments of other countries may renegotiate some or all of its global trade relationships and may impose or threaten to impose significant import tariffs.\n\nThe imposition of tariffs, trade restrictions, currency restrictions or similar actions (or retaliatory measures taken in response to such actions) could lead to price volatility and overall declines in U.S. and global investment markets.", "In addition, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the \u201cHFCAA\u201d) could cause securities of a foreign (non-U.S.) company, including ADRs, to be delisted from U.S. stock exchanges if the company does not allow the U.S. government to oversee the auditing of its financial information.\n\nAlthough the requirements of the HFCAA apply to securities of all foreign (non-U.S.) issuers, the SEC has thus far limited its enforcement efforts to securities of Chinese companies.\n\nIf securities are delisted, the Fund\u2019s ability to transact in such securities will be impaired, and the liquidity and market price of the securities may decline.\n\nThe Fund may also need to seek other markets in which to transact in such securities, which could increase the Fund\u2019s costs.\n\nCertain foreign governments may levy withholding or other taxes on dividend and interest income.", "Although in some countries a portion of these taxes may be recoverable, the non-recovered portion of foreign withholding taxes will reduce the income received from investments in such countries.\n\nSee \u201cTaxes\u201d, below.\n\nUnless otherwise noted in the Fund\u2019s Prospectus, the Adviser may consider an issuer to be from a particular country (including the United States) or geographic region if: (i) its principal securities trading market is in that country or geographic region; (ii) alone or on a consolidated basis it derives 50% or more of its annual revenue or profits from goods produced, sales made or services performed in that country or geographic region or has at least 50% of its assets, core business operations and/or employees in that country or geographic region; or (iii) it is organized under the laws of, or has a principal office in, that country or geographic region.", "By applying these tests, it is possible that a particular issuer could be deemed to be from more than one country or geographic region.\n\nForeign securities may include, without limitation, foreign equity securities, which are equity securities of a non-U.S. issuer, foreign government fixed-income securities, which are fixed-income securities issued by a government other than the U.S. Government or government-related issuer in a country other than the United States, and foreign corporate fixed-income securities, which are fixed-income securities issued by a private issuer in a country other than the United States.\n\nOn February 1, 2022, the European Union adopted a settlement discipline regime pursuant to Central Securities Depositories Regulation (\u201cCSDR\u201d) that introduced new measures for the authorization and supervision of European Union Central Security Depositories.", "CSDR aims to reduce the number of settlement fails that occur in European Economic Area

penalties on participants that cause settlement fails and distribute these to receiving participants.\n\nThe CSDR requirements apply to transactions in transferable securities (e.g., stocks and bonds), money market instruments, shares of funds and emission allowances that will be settled through an EEA CSD and are admitted to trading or traded on an EEA trading venue or cleared by an EEA central counterparty.\n\nThe Fund may bear the net effect of any penalties and credits incurred under the CSDR in respect of its trading, which could increase the Fund\u2019s expenses and adversely affect Fund performance.", "The Adviser may seek reimbursement from the relevant broker, agent, or subadviser (as applicable), as determined by the Adviser from time to time, although there can be no assurance that the Adviser will seek such reimbursement or that the Fund will recover or be reimbursed for any amounts at issue.\n\nInvestments in foreign companies and countries are subject to economic sanction and trade laws in the United States and other jurisdictions.\n\nThese laws and related governmental actions may, from time to time, prohibit the Fund from investing in certain countries and in certain companies.\n\nInvestments in certain countries and companies may be, and have in the past been, restricted as a result of the imposition of economic sanctions.\n\nIn addition, economic sanction laws in the United States and other jurisdictions may prohibit the Fund from transacting with a particular country or countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals.", "These types of sanctions may significantly restrict or completely prohibit investment activities in certain jurisdictions.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nEconomic sanctions and other similar governmental actions could, among other things, effectively restrict or eliminate the Fund\u2019s ability to purchase or sell securities or groups of securities, and thus may make the Fund\u2019s investments in such securities less liquid or more difficult to value.\n\nIn addition, as a result of economic sanctions, the Fund may be forced to sell or otherwise dispose of investments at inopportune times or prices, which could result in losses to the Fund and increased transaction costs.\n\nThese conditions may be in place for a substantial period of time and enacted with limited advance notice to the Fund.", "In addition, such economic sanctions or other government restrictions may negatively impact the value or liquidity of the Fund\u2019s investments, and could impair the Fund\u2019s ability to meet its investment objective or invest in accordance with its investment strategy because the Fund may, for example, be prohibited from investing in securities issued by companies subject to such restrictions and the Fund could be required to freeze or divest its existing investments that the Adviser would otherwise consider to be attractive.\n\nThe risks posed by economic sanctions against a particular foreign country, its nationals or industries or businesses within the country may be heightened to the extent the Fund invests significantly in the affected country or region or in issuers from the affected country that depend on global markets.\n\nEmerging Market Securities.\n\nThe Fund may invest in emerging market securities.", "An emerging market security is a security issued by an emerging market foreign government or private issuer.\n\nAn emerging market foreign government or private issuer has one or more of the following characteristics: (i) its principal securities trading market is in an emerging market or developing country; (ii) alone or on a consolidated basis it derives 50% or more of its annual revenue or profits from goods produced, sales made or services performed in an emerging market or developing country or has at least 50% of its assets, core business operations and/or employees in an emerging market or developing country; or (iii) it is organized under the laws of, or has a principal office in, an emerging market or developing country.\n\nBased on these criteria it is possible for a security to be considered issued by an issuer in more than one country.", "Therefore, it is possible for the securities of any issuer that has one or more of these characteristics in connection with any emerging market or developing country not to be considered an emerging market security if it also has one or more of these characteristics in connection with a developed country.\n\nEmerging market describes any country that is generally considered to be an emerging or developing country by major organizations in the international financial community or by the Fund\u2019s benchmark index.\n\nThe economies of individual emerging market or developing countries may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product, rate of inflation or deflation, currency depreciation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payments position.", "Further, the economies of developing countries generally are heavily dependent upon international trade and, accordingly, have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures.\n\nThese economies also have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade.\n\nPrior governmental approval for foreign investments may be required under certain circumstances in some emerging market or developing countries, and the extent of foreign investment in certain fixed-income securities and domestic companies may be subject to limitation in other emerging market or developing countries.\n\nForeign ownership limitations also may be imposed by the charters of individual companies in emerging market or developing countries to prevent, among other concerns, violation of foreign investment limitations.", "Repatriation of investment income, capital and the proceeds of sales by foreign investors may require governmental registration and/or approval in some emerging countries.\n\nThe Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required governmental registration or approval for such repatriation.\n\nAny investment subject to such repatriation controls will be considered illiquid if it appears reasonably likely that this process will take more than seven days.\n\nCertain emerging market countries may be subject to less stringent requirements regarding accounting, auditing, financial reporting and record keeping and therefore, material information related to an investment may not be available or reliable.\n\nIn addition, the Fund is limited in its ability to exercise its legal rights or enforce a counterparty\u2019s legal obligations in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States, in particular, in emerging markets countries.", "Investment in emerging market or developing countries may entail purchasing securities issued by or on behalf of entities that are insolvent, bankrupt, in default or otherwise engaged in an attempt to reorganize or reschedule their obligations and in entities that have little or no proven credit rating or credit history.\n\nIn any such case, the issuer\u2019s poor or deteriorating financial condition may increase the likelihood that the Fund will experience losses or diminution in available gains due to bankruptcy, insolvency or fraud.\n\nEmerging market or developing countries also pose the risk of nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, political changes, government regulation, social instability or diplomatic developments (including war) that could adversely affect the economies of such countries or the value of the Fund\u2019s investments in those countries.\n\nIn addition, it may be difficult to obtain and enforce a judgment in a court outside the United States.", "The Fund may also be exposed to an extra degree of custodial and/or market risk, especially where the securities purchased are not traded on an official exchange or where ownership records regarding the securities are maintained by an unregulated entity (or even the issuer itself).\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nDepositary Receipts.\n\nDepositary receipts represent an ownership interest in securities of foreign companies (an \u201cunderlying issuer\u201d) that are deposited with a depositary.\n\nDepositary receipts are not necessarily denominated in the same currency as the underlying securities.\n\nDepositary receipts include American depositary receipts (\u201cADRs\u201d), global depositary receipts (\u201cGDRs\u201d) and other types of depositary receipts (which, together with ADRs and GDRs, are hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cDepositary Receipts\u201d).", "ADRs are dollar-denominated Depositary Receipts typically issued by a U.S. financial institution and evidence an ownership interest in a security or pool of securities issued by a foreign issuer.\n\nADRs are listed and traded in the United States.\n\nADRs also include American depositary shares.\n\nGDRs and other types of Depositary Receipts are typically issued by foreign banks or trust companies, although they also may be issued by U.S. financial institutions, and evidence ownership interests in a security or pool of securities issued by either a foreign or a U.S. corporation.\n\nGenerally, Depositary Receipts in registered form are designed for use in the U.S. securities market and Depositary Receipts in bearer form are designed for use in securities markets outside the United States.\n\nDepositary Receipts may be \u201csponsored\u201d or \u201cunsponsored.\u201d", "Sponsored Depositary Receipts are established jointly by a depositary and the underlying issuer, whereas unsponsored Depositary Receipts may be established by a depositary without participation by the underlying issuer.\n\nHolders of unsponsored Depositary Receipts generally bear all the costs associated with establishing unsponsored Depositary Receipts.\n\nIn addition, the issuers of the securities underlying unsponsored Depositary Receipts are not obligated to disclose material information in the United States and, therefore, there may be less information available regarding such issuers and there may not be a correlation between such information and the market value of the Depositary Receipts.\n\nFor purposes of the Fund\u2019s investment policies, the Fund\u2019s investments in Depositary Receipts will be deemed to be an investment in the underlying securities, except that ADRs may be deemed to be issued by a U.S. issuer.\n\nDerivatives.", "The Fund may, but is not required to, use various derivatives and other similar instruments as described below.\n\nDerivatives may be used for a variety of purposes including hedging, risk management, portfolio management or to seek to earn income.\n\nAny or all of the investment techniques described herein may be used at any time and there is no particular strategy that dictates the use of one technique rather than another, as the use of any derivative by the Fund is a function of numerous variables, including market conditions.\n\nThe Fund complies with applicable regulatory requirements when using derivatives.\n\nAlthough the Adviser seeks to use derivatives to further the Fund\u2019s investment objective, no assurance can be given that the use of derivatives will achieve this result.\n\nGeneral Risks of Derivatives.\n\nDerivatives utilized by the Fund may involve the purchase and sale of derivative instruments.\n\nA derivative is a financial instrument the value of which depends upon (or derives from)", "the value of another asset, security, interest rate, index or financial instrument.\n\nDerivatives may relate to a wide variety of underlying instruments, including equity and debt securities, indices, interest rates, currencies and other assets.\n\nCertain derivative instruments that the Fund may use and the risks of those instruments are described in further detail below.\n\nThe Fund may in the future also utilize derivatives techniques, instruments and strategies that may be newly developed or permitted as a result of regulatory changes, consistent with the Fund\u2019s investment objective and policies.\n\nSuch newly developed techniques, instruments and strategies may involve risks different than or in addition to those described herein.\n\nNo assurance can be given that any derivatives strategy employed by the Fund will be successful.", "The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the instruments underlying such derivatives.\n\nDerivatives are highly specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analyses different from other portfolio investments.\n\nThe use of derivative instruments requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but also of the derivative itself.\n\nCertain risk factors generally applicable to derivative transactions are described below.\n\n\u25a0 |  Derivatives are subject to the risk that the market value of the derivative itself or the market value of underlying instruments will change in a way adverse to the Fund\u2019s interests.\n\nThe Fund bears the risk that the Adviser may incorrectly forecast future market trends and other financial or economic factors or the value of the underlying security, index, interest rate or currency when establishing a derivatives position for the Fund.", "\u25a0 |  Derivatives may be subject to pricing risk, which exists when a derivative becomes extraordinarily expensive (or inexpensive) relative to historical prices or corresponding instruments.\n\nUnder such market conditions, it may not be economically feasible to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position at an advantageous time or price.\n\n\u25a0 |  Many derivatives are complex and often valued subjectively.\n\nImproper valuations can result in increased payment requirements to counterparties or a loss of value to the Fund.\n\nMany derivatives may also involve operational and legal risks.\n\n\u25a0 |  Using derivatives as a hedge against a portfolio investment subjects the Fund to the risk that the derivative will have imperfect correlation with the portfolio investment, which could result in the Fund incurring substantial losses.", "This correlation risk may be greater in the case of derivatives based on an index or other basket of securities, as the portfolio securities being hedged may not duplicate the components of the underlying index or the basket may not be of exactly the same type of obligation as those underlying the derivative.\n\nThe use of derivatives for \u201ccross hedging\u201d purposes (using a derivative based on one instrument as a hedge on a different instrument) may also involve greater correlation risks.\n\n\u25a0 |  While using derivatives for hedging purposes can reduce the Fund\u2019s risk of loss, it may also limit the Fund\u2019s opportunity for gains or result in losses by offsetting or limiting the Fund\u2019s ability to participate in favorable price movements in portfolio investments.\n\nBack to Table of Contents", "\u25a0 |  Derivatives transactions for non-hedging purposes involve greater risks and may result in losses which would not be offset by increases in the value of portfolio securities or declines in the cost of securities to be acquired.\n\nIn the event that the Fund enters into a derivatives transaction as an alternative to purchasing or selling the underlying instrument or in order to obtain desired exposure to an index or market, the Fund will be exposed to the same risks as are incurred in purchasing or selling the underlying instruments directly as well as the additional risks associated with derivatives transactions.\n\n\u25a0 |  The use of certain derivatives transactions, including OTC derivatives, involves the risk of loss resulting from the insolvency or bankruptcy of the counterparty to the contract or the failure by the counterparty to make required payments or otherwise comply with the terms of the contract.", "In the event of default by a counterparty, the Fund may have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction.\n\n\u25a0 |  Liquidity risk exists when a particular derivative is difficult to purchase or sell.\n\nIf a derivative transaction is particularly large or if the relevant market is illiquid, the Fund may be unable to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position at an advantageous time or price.\n\n\u25a0 |  While some derivatives are cleared through a regulated, central clearinghouse, many derivatives transactions are not entered into or traded on exchanges or in markets regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) or the SEC.\n\nInstead, in some cases, certain types of bilateral OTC derivatives are entered into directly by the Fund and a counterparty and may be traded only through financial institutions acting as market makers.", "OTC derivatives transactions can only be entered into with a willing counterparty that is approved by the Adviser in accordance with guidelines established by the Board.\n\nWhere no such counterparty is available, the Fund will be unable to enter into a desired OTC transaction.\n\nThere also may be greater risk that no liquid secondary market in the trading of OTC derivatives will exist, in which case the Fund may be required to hold such instruments until exercise, expiration or maturity.\n\nMany of the protections afforded to participants in the cleared derivatives markets are not available to participants in bilateral OTC derivatives transactions.\n\nBilateral OTC derivatives transactions are not subject to the guarantee of a clearinghouse and, as a result, the Fund would bear greater risk of default by the counterparties to such transactions.", "\u25a0 |  The Fund may be required to make physical delivery of portfolio securities underlying a derivative in order to close out or to meet margin and payment requirements and a derivatives position or to sell portfolio securities at a time or price at which it may be disadvantageous to do so in order to obtain cash to close out or to maintain a derivatives position.\n\n\u25a0 |  As a result of the structure of certain derivatives, adverse changes in, among other things, interest rates, volatility or the value of the underlying instrument can result in losses substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative itself.\n\nCertain derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the initial investment.\n\n\u25a0 |  Certain derivatives may be classified as illiquid and therefore subject to the Fund\u2019s limitation on investments in illiquid investments.", "\u25a0 |  Derivatives transactions conducted outside the United States may not be conducted in the same manner as those entered into on U.S. exchanges, and may be subject to different margin, exercise, settlement or expiration procedures.\n\nBrokerage commissions, clearing costs and other transaction costs may be higher on foreign exchanges.\n\nMany of the risks of OTC derivatives transactions are also applicable to derivatives transactions conducted outside the United States.\n\nDerivatives transactions conducted outside the United States are subject to the risk of governmental action affecting the trading in, or the prices of, foreign securities, currencies and other instruments.\n\nThe value of such positions could be adversely affected by foreign political and economic factors; lesser availability of data on which to make trading decisions; delays on the Fund\u2019s ability to act upon economic events occurring in foreign markets; and less liquidity than U.S. markets.", "\u25a0 |  Currency derivatives are subject to additional risks.\n\nCurrency derivatives transactions may be negatively affected by government exchange controls, blockages and manipulation.\n\nCurrency exchange rates may be influenced by factors extrinsic to a country\u2019s economy.\n\nThere is no systematic reporting of last sale information with respect to underlying foreign currencies.\n\nAs a result, the available information on which trading in currency derivatives will be based may not be as complete as comparable data for other transactions.\n\nEvents could occur in the foreign currency market which will not be reflected in currency derivatives until the following day, making it more difficult for the Fund to respond to such events in a timely manner.\n\nOptions.", "An option is a contract that gives the holder of the option the right, but not the obligation, to buy from (in the case of a call option) or sell to (in the case of a put option) the buyer or seller, as applicable, of the option (the \u201coption writer\u201d) the underlying instrument at a specified fixed price (the \u201cexercise price\u201d) on or prior to a specified date for American options or only at expiration for European options (the \u201cexpiration date\u201d).\n\nThe buyer of the option pays to the option writer the option premium, which is the purchase price of the option.\n\nExchange-traded options are issued by a regulated intermediary such as the Options Clearing Corporation (\u201cOCC\u201d), which guarantees the performance of the obligations of the parties to such options.\n\nOTC options are purchased from or sold to counterparties through direct bilateral agreements between the Fund and its counterparties.", "Certain options, such as options on individual securities, are settled through physical delivery of the underlying security, whereas other options, such as index options, may be settled in cash in an amount based on the difference between the value of the underlying instrument and the strike price, which is then multiplied by a specified multiplier.\n\nWriting Options.\n\nThe Fund may write call and put options.\n\nAs the writer of a call option, the Fund receives the premium from the purchaser of the option and has the obligation, upon exercise of the option, to deliver the underlying security upon payment of the\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nexercise price.\n\nIf the option expires without being exercised the Fund is not required to deliver the underlying security and retains the premium received.\n\nThe Fund may write call options that are \u201ccovered.\u201d", "A call option on a security is covered if (a) the Fund owns the security underlying the call or has an absolute and immediate right to acquire that security without additional cash consideration (or, if additional cash consideration is required, such amount is maintained by the Fund in earmarked or segregated cash or liquid assets) upon conversion or exchange of other securities held by the Fund; or (b) the Fund has purchased a call on the underlying security, the exercise price of which is (i) equal to or less than the exercise price of the call written, or (ii) greater than the exercise price of the call written, provided the difference is maintained by the Fund in earmarked or segregated cash or liquid assets.\n\nSelling call options involves the risk that the Fund may be required to sell the underlying security at a disadvantageous price, below the market price of such security, at the time the option is exercised.", "As the writer of a covered call option, the Fund forgoes, during the option\u2019s life, the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the underlying security covering the option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline.\n\nThe Fund may write put options.\n\nAs the writer of a put option, the Fund receives the premium from the purchaser of the option and has the obligation, upon exercise of the option, to pay the exercise price and receive delivery of the underlying security.\n\nIf the option expires without being exercised, the Fund is not required to receive the underlying security in exchange for the exercise price and retains the option premium.\n\nThe Fund may write put options that are \u201ccovered.\u201d", "A put option on a security is covered if (a) the Fund earmarks or segregates cash or liquid assets equal to the exercise price; or (b) the Fund has purchased a put on the same security as the put written, the exercise price of which is (i) equal to or greater than the exercise price of the put written, or (ii) less than the exercise price of the put written, provided the difference is maintained by the Fund in earmarked or segregated cash or liquid assets.\n\nSelling put options involves the risk that the Fund may be required to buy the underlying security at a disadvantageous price, above the market price of such security, at the time the option is exercised.\n\nWhile the Fund\u2019s potential gain in writing a covered put option is limited to the premium received plus the interest earned on the liquid assets covering the put option, the Fund\u2019s risk of loss is equal to the entire value of the underlying security, offset only by the amount of the premium received.", "The Fund may close out an options position that it has written through a closing purchase transaction.\n\nThe Fund could execute a closing purchase transaction with respect to a written call option by purchasing a call option on the same underlying security that has the same exercise price and expiration date as the call option written by the Fund.\n\nThe Fund could execute a closing purchase transaction with respect to a put option written by purchasing a put option on the same underlying security and having the same exercise price and expiration date as the put option written by the Fund.\n\nA closing purchase transaction may or may not result in a profit to the Fund.\n\nThe Fund can close out its position as an option writer only if a liquid market exists for options on the same underlying security that have the same exercise price and expiration date as the option written by the Fund.\n\nThere is no assurance that such a market will exist with respect to any particular option.", "The writer of an American option generally has no control over the time when the option is exercised and the option writer is required to deliver or acquire the underlying security.\n\nOnce an option writer has received an exercise notice, it cannot effect a closing purchase transaction in order to terminate its obligation under the option.\n\nThus, the use of options may require the Fund to buy or sell portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices other than the current market values of such securities, which may limit the amount of appreciation the Fund can realize on an investment, or may cause the Fund to hold a security that it might otherwise sell.\n\nPurchasing Options.\n\nThe Fund may purchase call and put options.\n\nAs the buyer of a call option, the Fund pays the premium to the option writer and has the right to purchase the underlying security from the option writer at the exercise price.", "If the market price of the underlying security rises above the exercise price, the Fund could exercise the option and acquire the underlying security at a below-market price, which could result in a gain to the Fund, minus the premium paid.\n\nAs the buyer of a put option, the Fund pays the premium to the option writer and has the right to sell the underlying security to the option writer at the exercise price.\n\nIf the market price of the underlying security declines below the exercise price, the Fund could exercise the option and sell the underlying security at an above-market price, which could result in a gain to the Fund, minus the premium paid.\n\nThe Fund may buy call and put options whether or not it holds the underlying securities.\n\nAs a buyer of a call or put option, the Fund may sell put or call options that it has purchased at any time prior to such option\u2019s expiration date through a closing sale transaction.", "The principal factors affecting the market value of a put or a call option include supply and demand, interest rates, the current market price of the underlying security in relation to the exercise price of the option, the volatility of the underlying security, the underlying security\u2019s dividend policy, and the time remaining until the expiration date.\n\nA closing sale transaction may or may not result in a profit to the Fund.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s ability to initiate a closing sale transaction is dependent upon the liquidity of the options market and there is no assurance that such a market will exist with respect to any particular option.\n\nIf the Fund does not exercise or sell an option prior to its expiration date, the option expires and becomes worthless.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nOTC Options.", "Unlike exchange-traded options, which are standardized with respect to the underlying instrument, expiration date, contract size and strike price, the terms of OTC options generally are established through negotiation between the parties to the options contract.\n\nThis type of arrangement allows the purchaser and writer greater flexibility to tailor the option to their needs.\n\nOTC options are available for a greater variety of securities or baskets of securities, and in a wider range of expiration dates and exercise prices, than exchange-traded options.\n\nHowever, unlike exchange-traded options, which are issued and guaranteed by a regulated intermediary, such as the OCC, OTC options are entered into directly with the counterparty.\n\nUnless the counterparties provide for it, there is no central clearing or guaranty function for an OTC option.\n\nTherefore, OTC options are subject to the risk of default or non-performance by the counterparty.", "Accordingly, the Adviser must assess the creditworthiness of the counterparty to determine the likelihood that the terms of the option will be satisfied.\n\nThere can be no assurance that a continuous liquid secondary market will exist for any particular OTC option at any specific time.\n\nAs a result, the Fund may be unable to enter into closing sale transactions with respect to OTC options.\n\nIndex Options.\n\nCall and put options on indices operate similarly to options on securities.\n\nRather than the right to buy or sell a single security at a specified price, options on an index give the holder the right to receive, upon exercise of the option, an amount of cash determined by reference to the difference between the value of the underlying index and the strike price.\n\nThe underlying index may be a broad-based index or a narrower market index.\n\nUnlike many options on securities, all settlements are in cash.", "The settlement amount, which the writer of an index option must pay to the holder of the option upon exercise, is generally equal to the difference between the strike price of the option and the value of the underlying index, multiplied by a specified multiplier.\n\nThe multiplier determines the size of the investment position the option represents.\n\nGain or loss to the Fund on index options transactions will depend, in part, on price movements of the underlying index generally or in a particular segment of the index rather than price movements of individual components of the index.\n\nAs with other options, the Fund may close out its position in index options through closing purchase transactions and closing sale transactions provided that a liquid secondary market exists for such options.", "Index options written by the Fund may be covered in a manner similar to the covering of other types of options, by holding an offsetting financial position and/or earmarking or segregating cash or liquid assets.\n\nThe Fund may cover call options written on an index by owning securities or other assets whose price changes, in the opinion of the Adviser, are expected to correlate to those of the underlying index.\n\nForeign Currency Options.\n\nOptions on foreign currencies operate similarly to options on securities.\n\nRather than the right to buy or sell a single security at a specified price, options on foreign currencies give the holder the right to buy or sell foreign currency for a fixed amount in U.S. dollars or other base currencies.\n\nOptions on foreign currencies are traded primarily in the OTC market, but may also be traded on U.S. and foreign exchanges.", "The value of a foreign currency option is dependent upon the value of the underlying foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar or other base currency.\n\nThe price of the option may vary with changes, among other things, in the value of either or both currencies and has no relationship to the investment merits of a foreign security.\n\nOptions on foreign currencies are affected by all of those factors that influence foreign exchange rates and foreign investment generally.\n\nAs with other options, the Fund may close out its position in foreign currency options through closing purchase transactions and closing sale transactions provided that a liquid market exists for such options.\n\nForeign currency options written by the Fund may be covered in a manner similar to the covering of other types of options, by holding an offsetting financial position and/or earmarking or segregating cash or liquid assets.\n\nOptions on Futures Contracts.", "Options on futures contracts are similar to options on securities except that options on futures contracts give the purchasers the right, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in a futures contract (a long position in the case of a call option and a short position in the case of a put option) at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration of the option.\n\nUpon exercise of the option, the parties will be subject to all of the risks associated with futures transactions and subject to margin requirements.\n\nAs the writer of options on futures contracts, the Fund would also be subject to initial and variation margin requirements on the option position.\n\nOptions on futures contracts written by the Fund may be covered in a manner similar to the covering of other types of options, by holding an offsetting financial position and/or earmarking or segregating cash or liquid assets.", "The Fund may cover an option on a futures contract by purchasing or selling the underlying futures contract.\n\nIn such instances the exercise of the option will serve to close out the Fund\u2019s futures position.\n\nAdditional Risks of Options Transactions.\n\nThe risks associated with options transactions are different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying instruments.\n\nOptions are highly specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analyses different from those associated with other portfolio investments.\n\nThe use of options requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but also of the option itself.\n\nOptions may be subject to the risk factors generally applicable to derivatives transactions described herein, and may also be subject to certain additional risk factors, including:", "\u25a0 |  The exercise of options written or purchased by the Fund could cause the Fund to sell portfolio securities, thus increasing the Fund\u2019s portfolio turnover.\n\n\u25a0 |  The Fund pays brokerage commissions each time it writes or purchases an option or buys or sells an underlying security in\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\n|  connection with the exercise of an option.\n\nSuch brokerage commissions could be higher relative to the commissions for direct purchases of sales of the underlying securities.\n\n\u25a0 |  The Fund\u2019s options transactions may be subject to limitations on options positions established by the SEC, the CFTC or the exchanges on which such options are traded.\n\n\u25a0 |  The hours of trading for exchange-listed options may not coincide with the hours during which the underlying securities are traded.", "To the extent that the options markets close before the markets for the underlying securities, significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying securities that cannot be reflected in the options markets.\n\n\u25a0 |  Index options based upon a narrow index of securities or other assets may present greater risks than options based on broad market indices, as narrower indices are more susceptible to rapid and extreme fluctuations as a result of changes in the values of a smaller number of securities or other assets.\n\n\u25a0 |  The Fund is subject to the risk of market movements between the time that an option is exercised and the time of performance thereunder, which could increase the extent of any losses suffered by the Fund in connection with options transactions.\n\nFutures Contracts.\n\nA futures contract is a standardized agreement to buy or sell a specific quantity of an underlying asset, reference rate or index at a specific price at a specific future time (the \u201csettlement date\u201d).", "Futures contracts may be based on, among other things, a specified equity security (securities futures), a specified debt security or reference rate (interest rate futures), the value of a specified securities index (index futures) or the value of a foreign currency (currency futures).\n\nWhile the value of a futures contract tends to increase and decrease in tandem with the value of the underlying instrument, differences between the futures market and the market for the underlying asset may result in an imperfect correlation.\n\nThe buyer of a futures contract agrees to purchase the underlying instrument on the settlement date and is said to be \u201clong\u201d the contract.\n\nThe seller of a futures contract agrees to sell the underlying instrument on the settlement date and is said to be \u201cshort\u201d the contract.\n\nFutures contracts call for settlement only on the expiration date and cannot be \u201cexercised\u201d at any other time during their term.", "Depending on the terms of the particular contract, futures contracts are settled through either physical delivery of the underlying instrument on the settlement date (such as in the case of futures based on a specified debt security) or by payment of a cash settlement amount on the settlement date (such as in the case of futures contracts relating to broad-based securities indices).\n\nIn the case of cash-settled futures contracts, the settlement amount is equal to the difference between the reference instrument\u2019s price on the last trading day of the contract and the reference instrument\u2019s price at the time the contract was entered into.\n\nMost futures contracts, particularly futures contracts requiring physical delivery, are not held until the settlement date, but instead are offset before the settlement date through the establishment of an opposite and equal futures position (buying a contract that had been sold, or selling a contract that had been purchased).", "All futures transactions are effected through a clearinghouse associated with the exchange on which the futures are traded.\n\nThe buyer and seller of a futures contract are not required to deliver or pay for the underlying commodity unless the contract is held until the settlement date.\n\nHowever, both the buyer and seller are required to deposit \u201cinitial margin\u201d with a futures commission merchant (\u201cFCM\u201d) when the futures contract is entered into.\n\nInitial margin deposits are typically calculated as a percentage of the contract\u2019s market value.\n\nIf the value of either party\u2019s position declines, the party will be required to make additional \u201cvariation margin\u201d payments to settle the change in value on a daily basis.\n\nThe process is known as \u201cmarking-to-market.\u201d\n\nUpon the closing of a futures position through the establishment of an offsetting position, a final determination of variation margin will be made and additional cash will be paid by or released to the Fund.", "Additional Risks of Futures Transactions.\n\nThe risks associated with futures contract transactions are different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying instruments.\n\nFutures are highly specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analyses different from those associated with other portfolio investments.\n\nThe use of futures requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but also of the futures contract itself.\n\nFutures may be subject to the risk factors generally applicable to derivatives transactions described herein, and may also be subject to certain additional risk factors, including:\n\n\u25a0 |  The risk of loss in buying and selling futures contracts can be substantial.\n\nSmall price movements in the commodity, security, index, currency or instrument underlying a futures position may result in immediate and substantial loss (or gain) to the Fund.", "\u25a0 |  Buying and selling futures contracts may result in losses in excess of the amount invested in the position in the form of initial margin.\n\nIn the event of adverse price movements in the underlying commodity, security, index, currency or instrument, the Fund would be required to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin.\n\nThe Fund may be required to sell portfolio securities, or make or take delivery of the underlying securities in order to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so.\n\nThe Fund could lose margin payments deposited with an FCM if the FCM breaches its agreement with the Fund, becomes insolvent or declares bankruptcy.\n\n\u25a0 |  Most exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during any single trading day.\n\nOnce the daily limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made on that day at prices beyond that limit.", "If futures contract prices were to move to the daily limit for several trading days with little or no trading, the Fund could be prevented from prompt liquidation of a futures position and subject to substantial losses.\n\nThe daily limit governs only price movements during a single trading day and therefore does not limit the Fund\u2019s potential losses.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\n\u25a0 |  Index futures based upon a narrower index of securities may present greater risks than futures based on broad market indices, as narrower indices are more susceptible to rapid and extreme fluctuations as a result of changes in value of a small number of securities.\n\nCurrency Forwards.\n\nA foreign currency forward exchange contract is a negotiated agreement between two parties to exchange specified amounts of two or more currencies at a specified future time at a specified rate.", "The rate specified by the foreign currency forward exchange contract can be higher or lower than the spot rate between the currencies that are the subject of the contract.\n\nThe Fund may also invest in non-deliverable foreign currency forward exchange contracts (\u201cNDFs\u201d).\n\nNDFs are similar to other foreign currency forward exchange contracts, but do not require or permit physical delivery of currency upon settlement.\n\nInstead, settlement is made in cash based on the difference between the contracted exchange rate and the spot foreign exchange rate at settlement.\n\nCurrency futures are similar to foreign currency forward exchange contracts, except that they are traded on an exchange and standardized as to contract size and delivery date.\n\nMost currency futures call for payment or delivery in U.S. dollars.\n\nUnanticipated changes in currency prices may result in losses to the Fund and poorer overall performance for the Fund than if it had not entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts.", "The typical use of a foreign currency forward exchange contract is to \u201clock in\u201d the price of a security in U.S. dollars or some other foreign currency, which the Fund is holding in its portfolio.\n\nBy entering into a foreign currency forward exchange contract for the purchase or sale, for a fixed amount of dollars or other currency, of the amount of foreign currency involved in the underlying security transactions, the Fund may be able to protect itself against a possible loss resulting from an adverse change in the relationship between the U.S. dollar or other currency which is being used for the security purchase and the foreign currency in which the security is denominated during the period between the date on which the security is purchased or sold and the date on which payment is made or received.\n\nThe Adviser also may from time to time utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts for other purposes.", "For example, they may be used to hedge a foreign security held in the portfolio against a decline in value of the applicable foreign currency.\n\nThey also may be used to lock in the current exchange rate of the currency in which those securities anticipated to be purchased are denominated.\n\nAt times, the Fund may enter into \u201ccross-currency\u201d hedging transactions involving currencies other than those in which securities are held or proposed to be purchased are denominated.\n\nThe Fund will not enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts or maintain a net exposure to these contracts where the consummation of the contracts would obligate the Fund to deliver an amount of foreign currency in excess of the value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities.\n\nThe Fund may be limited in its ability to enter into hedging transactions involving foreign currency forward exchange contracts by the Code requirements relating to qualification as a regulated investment company (\u201cRIC\u201d).", "Foreign currency forward exchange contracts may limit gains on portfolio securities that could otherwise be realized had they not been utilized and could result in losses.\n\nThe contracts also may increase the Fund\u2019s volatility and may involve a significant amount of risk relative to the investment of cash.\n\nSwaps.\n\nAn OTC swap contract is an agreement between two parties pursuant to which the parties exchange payments at specified dates on the basis of a specified notional amount, with the payments calculated by reference to specified securities, indices, reference rates, currencies or other instruments.\n\nMost swap agreements provide that when the period payment dates for both parties are the same, the payments are made on a net basis (i.e., the two payment streams are netted out, with only the net amount paid by one party to the other).", "The Fund\u2019s obligations or rights under a swap contract entered into on a net basis will generally be equal only to the net amount to be paid or received under the agreement, based on the relative values of the positions held by each counterparty.\n\nMany swap agreements are not entered into or traded on exchanges and often there is no central clearing or guaranty function for swaps.\n\nThese OTC swaps are often subject to the risk of default or non-performance by the counterparty.\n\nAccordingly, the Adviser must assess the creditworthiness of the counterparty to determine the likelihood that the terms of the swap will be satisfied.\n\nSwap agreements allow for a wide variety of transactions.", "For example, fixed-rate payments may be exchanged for floating rate payments, U.S. dollar-denominated payments may be exchanged for payments denominated in foreign currencies, and payments tied to the price of one security, index, reference rate, currency or other instrument may be exchanged for payments tied to the price of a different security, index, reference rate, currency or other instrument.\n\nSwap contracts are typically individually negotiated and structured to provide exposure to a variety of particular types of investments or market factors.\n\nSwap contracts can take many different forms and are known by a variety of names.\n\nTo the extent consistent with the Fund\u2019s investment objective and policies, the Fund is not limited to any particular form or variety of swap contract.\n\nThe Fund may utilize swaps to increase or decrease its exposure to the underlying instrument, reference rate, foreign currency, market index or other asset.", "The Fund may also enter into related derivative instruments including caps, floors and collars.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and related regulatory developments require the eventual clearing and exchange-trading of many standardized OTC derivative instruments that the CFTC and SEC defined as \u201cswaps\u201d and \u201csecurity based swaps,\u201d respectively.\n\nMandatory exchange-trading and clearing is occurring on a phased-in basis based on the type of market participant and CFTC approval of contracts for central clearing and exchange-trading.\n\nIn a cleared swap, the Fund\u2019s ultimate counterparty is a central clearinghouse rather than a brokerage firm, bank or other financial institution.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nThe Fund initially will enter into cleared swaps through an executing broker.", "Such transactions will then be submitted for clearing and, if cleared, will be held at regulated FCMs that are members of the clearinghouse that serves as the central counterparty.\n\nWhen the Fund enters into a cleared swap, it must deliver to the central counterparty (via an FCM) an amount referred to as \u201cinitial margin.\u201d\n\nInitial margin requirements are determined by the central counterparty, but an FCM may require additional initial margin above the amount required by the central counterparty.\n\nDuring the term of the swap agreement, a \u201cvariation margin\u201d amount may also be required to be paid by the Fund or may be received by the Fund in accordance with margin controls set for such accounts, depending upon changes in the price of the underlying reference asset subject to the swap agreement.", "At the conclusion of the term of the swap agreement, if the Fund has a loss equal to or greater than the margin amount, the margin amount is paid to the FCM along with any loss that is greater than such margin amount.\n\nIf the Fund has a loss of less than the margin amount, the excess margin is returned to the Fund.\n\nIf the Fund has a gain, the full margin amount and the amount of the gain is paid to the Fund.\n\nCentral clearing is designed to reduce counterparty credit risk compared to uncleared swaps because central clearing interposes the central clearinghouse as the counterparty to each participant\u2019s swap, but it does not eliminate those risks completely.\n\nThere is also a risk of loss by the Fund of the initial and variation margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of the FCM with which the Fund has an open position in a swap contract.", "The assets of the Fund may not be fully protected in the event of the bankruptcy of the FCM or central counterparty because the Fund might be limited to recovering only a pro rata share of all available funds and margin segregated on behalf of an FCM\u2019s or central counterparty\u2019s customers or clearing members.\n\nIf the FCM does not provide accurate reporting, the Fund is also subject to the risk that the FCM could use the Fund\u2019s assets, which are held in an omnibus account with assets belonging to the FCM\u2019s other customers, to satisfy its own financial obligations or the payment obligations of another customer to the central counterparty.\n\nAs a result of recent regulatory developments, certain standardized swaps are currently subject to mandatory central clearing and some of these cleared swaps must be traded on an exchange or swap execution facility (\u201cSEF\u201d).", "An SEF is an electronic trading platform in which multiple market participants can execute swap transactions by accepting bids and offers made by multiple other participants on the platform.\n\nTransactions executed on an SEF may increase market transparency and liquidity but may cause the Fund to incur increased expenses to execute swaps.\n\nCentral clearing should decrease counterparty risk and increase liquidity compared to bilateral swaps because central clearing interposes the central clearinghouse as the counterparty to each participant\u2019s swap.\n\nHowever, central clearing does not eliminate counterparty risk or liquidity risk entirely.\n\nIn addition, depending on the size of the Fund and other factors, the margin required under the rules of a clearinghouse and by a clearing member may be in excess of the collateral required to be posted by the Fund to support its obligations under a similar bilateral swap.", "However, the CFTC and other applicable regulators have adopted rules imposing certain margin requirements, including minimums, on uncleared swaps which may result in the Fund and its counterparties posting higher margin amounts for uncleared swaps.\n\nRequiring margin on uncleared swaps may reduce, but not eliminate, counterparty credit risk.\n\nIn addition, with respect to cleared swaps, the Fund may not be able to obtain as favorable terms as it would be able to negotiate for an uncleared swap.\n\nIn addition, an FCM may unilaterally impose position limits or additional margin requirements for certain types of swaps in which the Fund may invest.\n\nCentral counterparties and FCMs generally can require termination of existing cleared swap transactions at any time, and can also require increases in margin above the margin that is required at the initiation of the swap agreement.", "Margin requirements for cleared swaps vary on a number of factors, and the margin required under the rules of the clearinghouse and FCM may be in excess of the collateral required to be posted by the Fund to support its obligations under a similar uncleared swap.\n\nHowever, as noted above, regulators have adopted rules imposing certain margin requirements, including minimums, on uncleared swaps, which may result in the Fund and its counterparties posting higher margin amounts for uncleared swaps.\n\nRequiring margin on uncleared swaps may reduce, but not eliminate, counterparty credit risk.\n\nThe Fund is also subject to the risk that, after entering into a cleared swap with an executing broker, no FCM or central counterparty is willing or able to clear the transaction.\n\nIn such an event, the central counterparty would void the trade.\n\nBefore the Fund can enter into a new trade, market conditions may become less favorable to the Fund.", "The Adviser will continue to monitor developments regarding trading and execution of cleared swaps on exchanges, particularly to the extent regulatory changes affect the Fund\u2019s ability to enter into swap agreements and the costs and risks associated with such investments.\n\nInterest Rate Swaps, Caps, Floors and Collars.\n\nInterest rate swaps consist of an agreement between two parties to exchange their respective commitments to pay or receive interest (e.g., an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed-rate payments).\n\nInterest rate swaps are generally entered into on a net basis.\n\nInterest rate swaps do not involve the delivery of securities, other underlying assets, or principal.\n\nAccordingly, the risk of market loss with respect to interest rate and total rate of return swaps is typically limited to the net amount of interest payments that the Fund is contractually obligated to make.\n\nThe Fund may also buy or sell interest rate caps, floors and collars.", "The purchase of an interest rate cap entitles the purchaser, to the extent that a specified interest rate index exceeds a predetermined level, to receive payments of interest on a specified notional amount from the party selling the interest rate cap.\n\nThe purchase of an interest rate floor entitles the purchaser, to the extent that a\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nspecified interest rate falls below a predetermined level, to receive payments of interest on a specified notional amount from the party selling the interest rate floor.\n\nA collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest rates.\n\nCaps, floors and collars may be less liquid than other types of derivatives.\n\nIndex Swaps.\n\nAn index swap consists of an agreement between two parties in which a party typically exchanges a cash flow based on a notional amount of a reference index for a cash flow based on a different index or on another specified instrument or reference rate.", "Index swaps are generally entered into on a net basis.\n\nInflation Swaps.\n\nInflation swap agreements are contracts in which one party typically agrees to pay the cumulative percentage increase in a price index, such as the Consumer Price Index, over the term of the swap (with some lag on the referenced inflation index), and the other party pays a compounded fixed rate.\n\nInflation swap agreements may be used to protect the NAV of the Fund against an unexpected change in the rate of inflation measured by an inflation index.\n\nThe value of inflation swap agreements is expected to change in response to changes in real interest rates.\n\nReal interest rates are tied to the relationship between nominal interest rates and the rate of inflation.\n\nCurrency Swaps.", "A currency swap consists of an agreement between two parties to exchange cash flows on a notional amount of two or more currencies based on the relative value differential among them, such as exchanging a right to receive a payment in foreign currency for the right to receive U.S. dollars.\n\nCurrency swap agreements may be entered into on a net basis or may involve the delivery of the entire principal value of one designated currency in exchange for the entire principal value of another designated currency.\n\nIn such cases, the entire principal value of a currency swap is subject to the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual delivery obligations.\n\nSwaptions.\n\nAn option on a swap agreement, also called a \u201cswaption,\u201d is an option that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a swap on a future date in exchange for a premium.\n\nA receiver swaption gives the owner the right to receive the return of a specified asset, reference rate, or index.", "A payer swaption gives the owner the right to pay the return of a specified asset, reference rate, or index.\n\nSwaptions also include options that allow an existing swap to be terminated or extended by one of the counterparties.\n\nGeneral Risks of Swaps.\n\nThe risks associated with swap transactions are different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying instruments.\n\nSwaps are highly specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analyses different from those associated with other portfolio investments.\n\nThe use of swaps requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but also of the swap contract itself.\n\nSwap transactions may be subject to the risk factors generally applicable to derivatives transactions described above, and may also be subject to certain additional risk factors, including:", "\u25a0 |  OTC swap agreements are not traded on exchanges and may be subject to liquidity risk, which exists when a particular swap is difficult to purchase or sell.\n\n\u25a0 |  \n\nIn addition to the risk of default by the counterparty, if the creditworthiness of a counterparty to a swap agreement declines, the value of the swap agreement would be likely to decline, potentially resulting in losses.\n\n\u25a0 |  The swaps market is subject to extensive regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act and certain CFTC and SEC rules promulgated thereunder.\n\nIt is possible that further developments in the swaps market, including new and additional governmental regulation, could result in higher Fund costs and expenses and could adversely affect the Fund\u2019s ability to utilize swaps, terminate existing swap agreements or realize amounts to be received under such agreements.\n\nStructured Investments.\n\nThe Fund may invest in structured investments.", "A structured investment is a derivative security designed to offer a return linked to a particular underlying security, currency, commodity or market, for which the amount of principal repayment and/or interest payments is based on the change in value of such underlying security, currency, commodity or market, including, among others, currency exchange rates, interest rates, referenced bonds and stock indices or other financial references.\n\nStructured investments may come in various forms, including notes, warrants and options to purchase securities, and may be listed and traded on an exchange or otherwise traded in the OTC market.\n\nThe Fund will typically use structured investments to gain exposure to a permitted underlying security, currency, commodity or market when direct access to such security, currency, commodity or market is limited or inefficient from a tax, cost or regulatory standpoint.", "Investments in structured investments involve risks including issuer risk, counterparty risk and market risk.\n\nHolders of structured investments bear risks of the underlying investment and are subject to issuer or counterparty risk because the holders are relying on the creditworthiness of such issuer or counterparty and have no rights with respect to the underlying investment.\n\nCertain structured investments may be thinly traded or have a limited trading market and may have the effect of increasing the Fund\u2019s illiquidity to the extent that the Fund, at a particular point in time, may be unable to find qualified buyers for these investments.", "A structured investment may be linked either positively or negatively to an underlying security, currency, commodity, index or market and a change in interest rates, principal amount, volatility, currency values or other factors, depending on the structured investment\u2019s design, may result in a gain or loss that is a multiple of the movement of such interest rates, principal amount, volatility, currency values or other factors.\n\nApplication of a multiplier is comparable to the use of financial leverage, a speculative technique.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nLeverage magnifies the potential for gain and the risk of loss.\n\nAs a result, a relatively small decline in the value of the referenced factor could result in a relatively large loss in the value of a structured investment.\n\nOther types of structured investments include interests in entities organized and operated for the purpose of restructuring the investment characteristics of underlying investment interests or securities.", "This type of securitization or restructuring usually involves the deposit or purchase of an underlying security by a U.S. or foreign entity, such as a corporation or trust of specified instruments, and the issuance by that entity of one or more classes of securities backed by, or representing an interest in, the underlying instruments.\n\nThe cash flow or rate of return on the underlying investments may be apportioned among the newly issued securities to create different investment characteristics, such as varying maturities, credit quality, payment priorities and interest rate provisions.\n\nStructured investments that are subordinated, for example, in payment priority often offer higher returns, but may result in increased risks compared to other investments.\n\nCombined Transactions.", "Combined transactions involve entering into multiple derivatives transactions (such as multiple options transactions, including purchasing and writing options in combination with each other; multiple futures transactions; and combinations of options, futures, forward and swap transactions) instead of a single derivatives transaction in order to customize the risk and return characteristics of the overall position.\n\nCombined transactions typically contain elements of risk that are present in each of the component transactions.\n\nThe Fund may enter into a combined transaction instead of a single derivatives transaction when, in the opinion of the Adviser, it is in the best interest of the Fund to do so.\n\nBecause combined transactions involve multiple transactions, they may result in higher transaction costs and may be more difficult to close out.\n\nRegulatory Matters.", "Regulatory developments affecting the exchange-traded and OTC derivatives markets may impair the Fund\u2019s ability to manage or hedge its investment portfolio through the use of derivatives.\n\nIn particular, in October 2020, the SEC adopted a final rule related to the use of derivatives, short sales, reverse repurchase agreements and certain other transactions by registered investment companies that rescinded and withdrew the guidance of the SEC and its staff regarding asset segregation and cover transactions previously applicable to the Fund\u2019s derivatives and other transactions.\n\nThese requirements may limit the ability of the Fund to use derivatives and reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions as part of its investment strategies.", "The final rule requires the Fund to trade derivatives and other transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations subject to a value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d) leverage limit, certain derivatives risk management program and reporting requirements.\n\nGenerally, these requirements apply unless the Fund qualifies as a \u201climited derivatives user.\u201d\n\nUnder the final rule, when the Fund trades reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions, including certain tender option bonds, it needs to aggregate the amount of indebtedness associated with the reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions with the aggregate amount of any other senior securities representing indebtedness when calculating the Fund\u2019s asset coverage ratio or treat all such transactions as derivatives transactions.", "Reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions aggregated with other indebtedness do not need to be included in the calculation of whether the Fund is a limited derivatives user, but for funds subject to the VaR testing, reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions must be included for purposes of such testing whether treated as derivatives transactions or not.\n\nThe SEC also provided guidance in connection with the rule regarding use of securities lending collateral that may limit the Fund\u2019s securities lending activities.\n\nIn addition, under the rule, the Fund is permitted to invest in a security on a when-issued or forward-settling basis, or with a non-standard settlement cycle, and the transaction will be deemed not to involve a senior security under the 1940 Act, provided that (i) the Fund intends to physically settle the transaction and (ii) the transaction will settle within 35 days of its trade date (the \u201cDelayed-Settlement Securities Provision\u201d).", "The Fund may otherwise engage in such transactions that do not meet the conditions of the Delayed-Settlement Securities Provision so long as the Fund treats any such transaction as a \u201cderivatives transaction\u201d for purposes of compliance with the rule.\n\nFurthermore, under the rule, the Fund will be permitted to enter into an unfunded commitment agreement, and such unfunded commitment agreement will not be subject to the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act, if the Fund reasonably believes, at the time it enters into such agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all such agreements as they come due.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and the rules promulgated thereunder may limit the ability of the Fund to enter into one or more exchange-traded or OTC derivatives transactions.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s use of derivatives may also be limited by the requirements of the Code for qualification as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes.", "The Adviser, with respect to the Fund, has filed a notice of eligibility with the National Futures Association (\u201cNFA\u201d) claiming an exclusion from the definition of the term \u201ccommodity pool operator\u201d (\u201cCPO\u201d) pursuant to CFTC Regulation 4.5, as promulgated under the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (\u201cCEA\u201d), with respect to the Fund\u2019s operations.\n\nIn addition, the Adviser will operate the Subsidiary (as defined below) in reliance on an exemption from registration as a CPO under CFTC Regulation 4.13(a)(3).\n\nTherefore, neither the Fund nor the Adviser (with respect to the Fund and the Subsidiary) is subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool or CPO under the CEA.\n\nIf the Adviser or the Fund becomes subject to these requirements, as well as related NFA rules, the Fund may incur additional compliance and other expenses.\n\nBack to Table of Contents", "With respect to investments in swap transactions, commodity futures, commodity options or certain other commodity interests used for purposes other than bona fide hedging purposes, an investment company must meet one of the following tests under the CFTC amended regulations in order for its investment adviser to claim an exemption from being considered a CPO.\n\nFirst, the aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish an investment company\u2019s positions in such investments may not exceed five percent (5%) of the liquidation value of the investment company\u2019s portfolio (after accounting for unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any such investments).\n\nAlternatively, the aggregate net notional value of such instruments, determined at the time of the most recent position established, may not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the liquidation value of the investment company\u2019s portfolio (after accounting for unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any such positions).", "In addition to meeting one of the foregoing trading limitations, the investment company may not market itself as a commodity pool or otherwise as a vehicle for trading in the commodity futures, commodity options or swaps and derivatives markets.\n\nRegulations recently adopted by federal banking regulators under the Dodd-Frank Act require that certain qualified financial contracts (\u201cQFCs\u201d) with counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking organizations be amended to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default rights.\n\nQFCs include, but are not limited to, securities contracts, commodities contracts, forward contracts, repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements and swaps agreements, as well as related master agreements, security agreements, credit enhancements, and reimbursement obligations.", "If a covered counterparty of the Fund or certain of the covered counterparty\u2019s affiliates were to become subject to certain insolvency proceedings, the Fund may be temporarily unable to exercise certain default rights, and the QFC may be transferred to another entity.\n\nThese requirements may impact the Fund\u2019s credit and counterparty risks.\n\nContracts for Difference.\n\nThe Fund may purchase contracts for difference (\u201cCFDs\u201d).\n\nA CFD is a privately negotiated contract between two parties, buyer and seller, stipulating that the seller will pay to or receive from the buyer the difference between the nominal value of the underlying instrument at the opening of the contract and that instrument\u2019s value at the end of the contract.\n\nThe underlying instrument may be a single security, stock basket or index.\n\nA CFD can be set up to take either a short or long position on the underlying instrument.\n\nThe buyer and seller are typically both required to post margin, which is adjusted daily.", "The buyer will also pay to the seller a financing rate on the notional amount of the capital employed by the seller less the margin deposit.\n\nA CFD is usually terminated at the buyer\u2019s initiative.\n\nThe seller of the CFD will simply match the exposure of the underlying instrument in the open market and the parties will exchange whatever payment is due.\n\nAs is the case with owning any financial instrument, there is the risk of loss associated with buying a CFD.\n\nFor example, if the Fund buys a long CFD and the underlying security is worth less at the end of the contract, the Fund would be required to make a payment to the seller and would suffer a loss.\n\nAlso, there may be liquidity risk if the underlying instrument is illiquid because the liquidity of a CFD is based on the liquidity of the underlying instrument.\n\nA further risk is that adverse movements in the underlying security will require the buyer to post additional margin.", "CFDs also carry counterparty risk, i.e., the risk that the counterparty to the CFD transaction may be unable or unwilling to make payments or to otherwise honor its financial obligations under the terms of the contract.\n\nIf the counterparty were to do so, the value of the contract, and of the Fund\u2019s shares, may be reduced.\n\nThe Fund will not enter into a CFD transaction that is inconsistent with its investment objective, policies and strategies.\n\nWarrants.\n\nWarrants give holders the right, but not the obligation, to buy common stock of an issuer at a given price, usually higher than the market price at the time of issuance, during a specified period.\n\nWarrants are usually freely transferable.\n\nThe risk of investing in a warrant is that the warrant may expire prior to the market value of the common stock exceeding the price fixed by the warrant.", "The Fund may invest up to 5% of the value of its net assets in warrants, including not more than 2% in warrants not listed on either the New York Stock Exchange or the NYSE American.\n\nRights.\n\nRights represent the right, but not the obligation, for a fixed period of time to purchase additional shares of an issuer\u2019s common stock at the time of a new issuance, usually at a price below the initial offering price of the common stock and before the common stock is offered to the general public.\n\nRights are usually freely transferable.\n\nThe risk of investing in a right is that the right may expire prior to the market value of the common stock exceeding the price fixed by the right.\n\nHigh Yield Securities.", "High yield securities are generally considered to include fixed-income securities rated below the four highest rating categories at the time of purchase (e.g., Ba through C by Moody\u2019s, or BB through D by S&P or Fitch) and unrated fixed-income securities considered by the Adviser to be of equivalent quality.\n\nHigh yield securities are not considered investment grade and are commonly referred to as \u201cjunk bonds\u201d or high yield, high risk securities.\n\nInvestment grade securities that the Fund holds may be downgraded to below investment grade by the rating agencies.\n\nIf the Fund holds a security that is downgraded, the Fund may choose to retain the security.\n\nWhile high yield securities offer higher yields, they also normally carry a high degree of credit risk and are considered speculative by the major credit rating agencies.\n\nHigh yield securities may be issued as a consequence of corporate restructuring or similar events.", "High yield securities are often issued by smaller, less creditworthy issuers, or by highly leveraged (indebted) issuers, that are generally less able than more established or less leveraged issuers to make scheduled payments of interest and principal.\n\nIn comparison to investment grade securities, the price movement of these securities is influenced less by changes in interest rates and more by the\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nfinancial and business position of the issuer.\n\nThe values of high yield securities are more volatile and may react with greater sensitivity to market changes.\n\nHigh yield securities are frequently ranked junior to claims by other creditors.\n\nIf the issuer cannot meet its obligations, the senior obligations are generally paid off before the junior obligations, which will potentially limit the Fund\u2019s ability to fully recover principal or to receive interest payments when senior securities are in default.", "Thus, investors in high yield securities have a lower degree of protection with respect to principal and interest payments than do investors in higher rated securities.\n\nIn addition, lower-rated securities frequently have call or redemption features that would permit an issuer to repurchase the security from the Fund.\n\nIf a call were exercised by the issuer during a period of declining interest rates, the Fund likely would have to replace such called security with a lower yielding security, thus decreasing the net investment income to the Fund and any dividends to investors.\n\nThe secondary market for high yield securities is concentrated in relatively few market makers and is dominated by institutional investors, including mutual funds, insurance companies and other financial institutions.\n\nAccordingly, the secondary market for such securities is not as liquid as, and is more volatile than, the secondary market for higher-rated securities.", "Because high yield securities are less liquid, judgment may play a greater role in valuing certain of the Fund\u2019s securities than is the case with securities trading in a more liquid market.\n\nAlso, future legislation may have a possible negative impact on the market for high yield, high risk securities.\n\nThe credit rating of a high yield security does not necessarily address its market value risk.\n\nRatings and market value may change from time to time, positively or negatively, to reflect new developments regarding the issuer.\n\nThe high yield securities markets may react strongly to adverse news about an issuer or the economy, or to the perception or expectation of adverse news, whether or not it is based on fundamental analysis.\n\nAdditionally, prices for high yield securities may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments.", "These developments could adversely affect the Fund\u2019s NAV and investment practices, the secondary market for high yield securities, the financial condition of issuers of these securities and the value and liquidity of outstanding high yield securities, especially in a thinly traded market.\n\nInvestment Company Securities.\n\nInvestment company securities are equity securities and include securities of other registered open-end and closed-end investment companies and unregistered investment companies, including foreign investment companies, hedge funds and exchange-traded funds \u201cETFs\u201d).\n\nThe Fund may invest in investment company securities as may be permitted by (i) the 1940 Act; (ii) the rules and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) under the 1940 Act; or (iii) an exemption or other relief applicable to the Fund from provisions of the 1940 Act.", "The 1940 Act generally prohibits an investment company from acquiring more than 3% of the outstanding voting shares of an investment company and limits such investments to no more than 5% of the Fund\u2019s total assets in any one investment company and no more than 10% in any combination of investment companies.\n\nThe 1940 Act also prohibits the Fund from acquiring in the aggregate more than 10% of the outstanding voting shares of any registered closed-end investment company.\n\nThe Fund may invest in investment company securities of investment companies managed by the Adviser or its affiliates to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act or as otherwise authorized by the SEC.", "To the extent the Fund invests a portion of its assets in investment company securities, those assets will be subject to the risks of the purchased investment company\u2019s portfolio securities, and a shareholder in the Fund will bear not only their proportionate share of the expenses of the Fund, but also, indirectly the expenses of the purchased investment company.\n\nMoney Market Funds.\n\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, the Fund may invest all or some of its short term cash investments in any money market fund advised or managed by the Adviser or its affiliates.\n\nIn connection with any such investments, the Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, will pay its share of all expenses (other than advisory and administrative fees) of a money market fund in which it invests, which may result in the Fund bearing some additional expenses.", "The rules governing money market funds: (1) permit certain money market funds to impose a \u201cliquidity fee\u201d (up to 2%), if the board of trustees determines it is in the best interests of the fund, and (2) require \u201cinstitutional money market funds\u201d to operate with a floating net asset value per share (\u201cNAV\u201d) rounded to a minimum of the fourth decimal place in the case of a fund with a $1.0000 share price or an equivalent or more precise level of accuracy for money market funds with a different share price (e.g., $10.000 per share, or $100.00 per share).\n\nThe Fund may invest in money market funds that seek to maintain a stable $1.00 NAV per share or that have a share price that fluctuates.\n\nAlthough a stable share price money market fund seeks to maintain a stable $1.00 NAV per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in such a money market fund.", "With respect to a floating share price money market fund, because the share price will fluctuate, when the Fund sells its shares in such a fund, the shares may be worth more or less than what the Fund originally paid for them.\n\nThe rules governing money market funds, and amendments to such rules, may affect the investment strategies, performance and operating expenses of money market funds.\n\n\u201cGovernment money market funds,\u201d as defined under Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act, are exempt from these requirements, though such funds may choose to opt-in to the implementation of liquidity fees and redemption gates.\n\nExchange-Traded Funds.\n\nThe Fund may invest in ETFs.\n\nInvestments in ETFs are subject to a variety of risks, including risks of a direct investment in the underlying securities that the ETF holds.\n\nFor example, the general level of stock prices may decline, thereby adversely affecting the value of the underlying investments of the ETF and, consequently, the value of the ETF.", "In addition, the market value of the ETF shares may differ from their NAV because the supply and demand in the market for ETF shares at any point\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nis not always identical to the supply and demand in the market for the underlying securities.\n\nAlso, ETFs that track particular indices typically will be unable to match the performance of the index exactly due to, among other things, the ETF\u2019s operating expenses and transaction costs.\n\nETFs typically incur fees that are separate from those fees incurred directly by the Fund.\n\nTherefore, as a shareholder in an ETF (as with other investment companies), the Fund would bear its ratable share of that entity\u2019s expenses.\n\nAt the same time, the Fund would continue to pay its own investment management fees and other expenses.\n\nAs a result, the Fund and its shareholders, in effect, will be absorbing fees at two levels with respect to investments in ETFs.\n\nFurther, certain of the ETFs in which the Fund may invest are leveraged.", "Leveraged ETFs seek to deliver multiples of the performance of the index or other benchmark they track and use derivatives in an effort to amplify the returns of the underlying index or benchmark.\n\nWhile leveraged ETFs may offer the potential for greater return, the potential for loss and the speed at which losses can be realized also are greater.\n\nMost leveraged ETFs \u201creset\u201d daily, meaning they are designed to achieve their stated objectives on a daily basis.\n\nLeveraged ETFs can deviate substantially from the performance of their underlying benchmark over longer periods of time, particularly in volatile periods.\n\nThe more the Fund invests in such leveraged ETFs, the more this leverage will magnify any losses on those investments.\n\nFurthermore, disruptions in the markets for the securities underlying ETFs purchased or sold by the Fund could result in losses on the Fund\u2019s investment in ETFs.\n\nIlliquid Investments.", "In accordance with Rule 22e-4 (the \u201cLiquidity Rule\u201d) under the 1940 Act, the Fund may invest up to 15% of its net assets in \u201cilliquid investments\u201d that are assets.\n\nFor these purposes, \u201cilliquid investments\u201d are investments that the Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without the sale or disposition significantly changing the market value of the investment.\n\nFor the Fund, each portfolio investment must be classified at least monthly into one of four liquidity categories (illiquid, as discussed above, as well as highly liquid, moderately liquid and less liquid), which are defined pursuant to the Liquidity Rule and classified in accordance with the Fund\u2019s written liquidity risk management program by the program administrator designated by the Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees.", "Such classification is to be made using information obtained after reasonable inquiry and taking into account relevant market, trading and investment-specific considerations.\n\nIn making such classifications, the Fund determines whether trading varying portions of a position in a particular portfolio investment or asset class, in sizes that the Fund would reasonably anticipate trading, is reasonably expected to significantly affect its liquidity.\n\nIf so, this determination is taken into account when classifying the liquidity of that investment.\n\nThe Fund may be assisted in classification determinations by one or more third-party service providers.\n\nAssets classified according to this process as \u201cilliquid investments\u201d are those subject to the 15% limit on illiquid investments.", "In the event that changes in the portfolio or other external events cause the Fund to exceed this limit, the Fund must take steps to bring its illiquid investments that are assets to or below the applicable limit of its net assets within a reasonable period of time.\n\nThis requirement would not force the Fund to liquidate any portfolio investment.\n\nThe SEC has recently proposed amendments to the Liquidity Rule that, if adopted, would result in changes to the Fund\u2019s liquidity classification framework and could potentially increase the percentage of the Fund\u2019s investments classified as illiquid.\n\nIn addition, the Fund\u2019s operations and investment strategies may be adversely impacted if the proposed amendments are adopted.\n\nLIBOR Discontinuance or Unavailability Risk.", "The Fund\u2019s investments, payment obligations and financing terms may be based on floating rates, such as the London Interbank Offered Rates (collectively, \u201cLIBOR\u201d), Euro Interbank Offered Rate, Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) and other similar types of reference rates (each, a \u201cReference Rate\u201d).\n\nThese Reference Rates are generally intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other within certain financial markets.\n\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) was the basic rate of interest used in lending transactions between banks on the London interbank market and has been widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally.\n\nAs a result of benchmark reforms, publication of most LIBOR settings has ceased.", "However, the publication of certain other LIBORs will continue to be published on a temporary, synthetic and non-representative basis (e.g., the 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month USD LIBOR settings which are expected to be continued to be published until the end of September 2024).\n\nAs these synthetic LIBOR settings are expected to be published for a limited period of time and are considered non-representative of the underlying market, regulators have advised that these settings should be used only in limited circumstances.\n\nVarious financial industry groups have been planning for the transition from LIBOR and certain regulators and industry groups have taken actions to establish alternative reference rates (e.g., the SOFR, which measures the cost of overnight borrowings through repurchase agreement transactions collateralized with U.S. Treasury securities and is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBORs with certain adjustments).", "It is expected that a substantial portion of future floating rate investments will be linked to SOFR or benchmark rates derived from SOFR (or other Alternative Reference Rates based on SOFR).\n\nThere is no assurance that the composition or characteristics of any such alternative reference rate will be similar to or produce the same value or economic equivalence as LIBOR or that it will have the same volume or liquidity as did LIBOR.\n\nThese relatively new and developing rates may also behave differently than LIBOR would have or may not match the reference rate applicable to the underlying assets related to these investments.\n\nInvestments in structured finance investments, loans, debt instruments or other investments tied to reference rates are also subject to operational risk associated with the alternative reference rate, such as errors in the input data or in the calculation of reference rates.", "Additionally, the transition away from LIBOR and certain other Reference Rates could, among other negative consequences (i) adversely impact the pricing, liquidity, value of, return on and trading for a broad array of financial products, including any\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nReference Rate-linked securities, loans and derivatives in which the Fund may invest; (ii) require extensive negotiations of and/or amendments to agreements and other documentation governing Reference Rate-linked investments products; (iii) lead to disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties or portfolio companies regarding the interpretation and enforceability of \u201cfallback\u201d provisions that provide for an alternative reference rate in the event of Reference Rate unavailability; and/or (iv) cause the Fund to incur additional costs in relation to any of the above factors.", "The risks associated with the above factors, including decreased liquidity, may be heightened with respect to investments in so-called \u201ctough legacy\u201d Reference Rate-based products that do not include effective fallback provisions to address how interest rates will be determined if LIBOR and certain other Reference Rates stop being published.\n\nIn addition, when a Reference Rate is discontinued, the alternative Reference Rate may be lower than market expectations, which could have an adverse impact on the value of preferred and debt securities with floating or fixed-to-floating rate coupons.\n\nThese developments could negatively impact financial markets in general and present heightened risks, including with respect to the Fund\u2019s investments.\n\nAs a result of the uncertainty and developments relating to the transition process, performance, price volatility, liquidity and value of the Fund and its assets may be adversely affected.\n\nFixed-Income Securities.", "Fixed-income securities generally represent an issuer\u2019s obligation to repay to the investor (or lender) the amount borrowed plus interest over a specified time period.\n\nA typical fixed-income security specifies a fixed date when the amount borrowed (principal) is due in full, known as the maturity date, and specifies dates when periodic interest (coupon) payments will be made over the life of the security.\n\nFixed-income securities come in many varieties and may differ in the way that interest is calculated, the amount and frequency of payments, the type of collateral, if any, and the presence of special features (e.g., conversion rights).\n\nPrices of fixed-income securities fluctuate and, in particular, are subject to several key risks including, but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, prepayment risk and spread risk.\n\nInterest rate risk arises due to general changes in the level of market rates after the purchase of a fixed-income security.", "Generally, the values of fixed-income securities vary inversely with changes in interest rates.\n\nDuring periods of falling interest rates, the values of most outstanding fixed-income securities generally rise and during periods of rising interest rates, the values of most fixed-income securities generally decline.\n\nThe Fund may face a heightened level of interest rate risk in times of monetary policy change and/or uncertainty, such as when the Federal Reserve Board adjusts a quantitative easing program and/or changes rates.\n\nA changing interest rate environment increases certain risks, including the potential for periods of volatility, increased redemptions, shortened durations (i.e., prepayment risk) and extended durations (i.e., extension risk).\n\nThe Fund is not limited as to the maturities (when a debt security provides its final payment) or duration (measure of interest rate sensitivity) of the securities in which it may invest.", "While fixed-income securities with longer final maturities often have higher yields than those with shorter maturities, they usually possess greater price sensitivity to changes in interest rates and other factors.\n\nTraditionally, the remaining term to maturity has been used as a barometer of a fixed-income security\u2019s sensitivity to interest rate changes.\n\nThis measure, however, considers only the time until the final principal payment and takes no account of the pattern or amount of principal or interest payments prior to maturity.\n\nDuration combines consideration of yield, coupon, interest and principal payments, final maturity and call (prepayment) features.\n\nDuration measures the likely percentage change in a fixed-income security\u2019s price for a small parallel shift in the general level of interest rates; it is also an estimate of the weighted average life of the remaining cash flows of a fixed-income security.", "In almost all cases, the duration of a fixed-income security is shorter than its term to maturity.\n\nCredit risk represents the possibility that an issuer may be unable to meet scheduled interest and principal payment obligations.\n\nIt is most often associated with corporate bonds, although it can be present in other fixed-income securities as well.\n\nCredit ratings and quantitative models attempt to measure the degree of credit risk in fixed-income securities, and provide insight as to whether prevailing yield spreads afford sufficient compensation for such risk.\n\nOther things being equal, fixed-income securities with high degrees of credit risk should trade in the market at lower prices (and higher yields) than fixed-income securities with low degrees of credit risk.\n\nPrepayment risk, also known as call risk, arises due to the issuer\u2019s ability to prepay all or most of the fixed-income security prior to the stated final maturity date.", "Prepayments generally rise in response to a decline in interest rates as debtors take advantage of the opportunity to refinance their obligations.\n\nThis risk is often associated with mortgage securities where the underlying mortgage loans can be refinanced, although it can also be present in corporate or other types of bonds with call provisions.\n\nWhen a prepayment occurs, a Fund may be forced to reinvest in lower yielding fixed-income securities.\n\nQuantitative models are designed to help assess the degree of prepayment risk, and provide insight as to whether prevailing yield spreads afford sufficient compensation for such risk.\n\nSpread risk is the potential for the value of a Fund\u2019s assets to fall due to the widening of spreads.\n\nFixed-income securities generally compensate for greater credit risk by paying interest at a higher rate.", "The difference (or \u201cspread\u201d) between the yield of a security and the yield of a benchmark, such as a U.S. Treasury security with a comparable maturity, measures the additional interest paid for credit risk.\n\nAs the spread on a security widens (or increases), the price (or value) of the security falls.\n\nSpread widening may occur,\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\namong other reasons, as a result of market concerns over the stability of the market, excess supply, general credit concerns in other markets, security- or market-specific credit concerns or general reductions in risk tolerance.\n\nWhile assets in fixed-income markets have grown rapidly in recent years, the capacity for traditional dealer counterparties to engage in fixed-income trading has not kept pace and in some cases has decreased.\n\nFor example, primary dealer inventories of corporate bonds, which provide a core indication of the ability of financial intermediaries to \u201cmake markets,\u201d are at or near historic lows in relation to market size.", "This reduction in market-making capacity may be a persistent change, to the extent it is resulting from broader structural changes, such as fewer proprietary trading desks at broker-dealers and increased regulatory capital requirements.\n\nBecause market makers provide stability to a market through their intermediary services, the significant reduction in dealer inventories could potentially lead to decreased liquidity and increased volatility in the fixed-income markets.\n\nSuch issues may be exacerbated during periods of economic uncertainty.\n\nEconomic, political and other events also may affect the prices of broad fixed-income markets, although the risks associated with such events are transmitted to the market via changes in the prevailing levels of interest rates, credit risk, prepayment risk or spread risk.", "From time to time, uncertainty regarding the status of negotiations in the U.S. government to increase the statutory debt ceiling could impact the creditworthiness of the United States and could impact the liquidity of the U.S. Government securities markets and ultimately the Fund.\n\nCertain of the Fund\u2019s investments are subject to inflation risk, which is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money (i.e., as inflation increases, the values of the Fund\u2019s assets can decline).\n\nInflation rates may change frequently and significantly as a result of various factors, including unexpected shifts in the domestic or global economy and changes in economic policies, and a Fund\u2019s investments may not keep pace with inflation, which may result in losses to Fund shareholders.\n\nThis risk is greater for fixed-income instruments with longer maturities.\n\nInvestment Grade Securities.", "Investment grade securities are fixed-income securities rated by one or more of the rating agencies in one of the four highest rating categories at the time of purchase (e.g., AAA, AA, A or BBB by S&P Global Ratings Group, a division of S&P Global Inc. (\u201cS&P\u201d), or Fitch Ratings (\u201cFitch\u201d) or Aaa, Aa, A or Baa by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) or the equivalent by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization) or determined to be of equivalent quality by the Adviser.\n\nSecurities rated BBB or Baa represent the lowest of four levels of investment grade securities and are regarded as borderline between sound obligations and those in which speculative elements predominate.\n\nA Fund is permitted to hold investment grade securities or \u201chigh grade\u201d securities, and may hold unrated securities if the Adviser considers the risks involved in owning that security to be equivalent to the risks involved in holding an investment grade security.", "Ratings assigned to fixed-income securities represent only the opinion of the rating agency assigning the rating and are not dispositive of the credit risk associated with the purchase of a particular fixed-income security.\n\nMoreover, market risk also will affect the prices of even the highest rated fixed-income securities so that their prices may rise or fall even if the issuer\u2019s capacity to repay its obligations remains unchanged.\n\nCommercial Paper.\n\nCommercial paper refers to short-term fixed-income securities with maturities ranging from 1 to 397 days.\n\nThey are primarily issued by corporations needing to finance large amounts of receivables, but may be issued by banks and other borrowers.\n\nCommercial paper is issued either directly or through broker-dealers, and may be discounted or interest bearing.\n\nCommercial paper is unsecured.\n\nVirtually all commercial paper is rated by Moody\u2019s, Fitch or S&P.", "Commercial paper rated A-1 by S&P has the following characteristics: (1) liquidity ratios are adequate to meet cash requirements; (2) long-term senior debt is rated \u201cA\u201d or better; (3) the issuer has access to at least two additional channels of borrowing; (4) basic earnings and cash flow have an upward trend with allowance made for unusual circumstances; (5) typically, the issuer\u2019s industry is well established and the issuer has a strong position within the industry; and (6) the reliability and quality of management are unquestioned.\n\nRelative strength or weakness of the above factors determines whether the issuer\u2019s commercial paper is A-1, A-2 or A-3.\n\nThe rating Prime-1 is the highest commercial paper rating assigned by Moody\u2019s.", "Among the factors considered by Moody\u2019s in assigning ratings are the following: (1) evaluation of the management of the issuer; (2) economic evaluation of the issuer\u2019s industry or industries and the appraisal of speculative-type risks which may be inherent in certain areas; (3) evaluation of the issuer\u2019s products in relation to competition and customer acceptance; (4) liquidity; (5) amount and quality of long-term debt; (6) trend of earnings over a period of ten years; (7) financial strength of a parent company and the relationships that exist with the issuer; and (8) recognition by the management of obligations which may be present or may arise as a result of public interest questions and preparations to meet such obligations.", "With respect to Fitch, a short-term issuer or obligation rating is based in all cases on the short-term vulnerability to default of the rated entity and relates to the capacity to meet financial obligations in accordance with the documentation governing the relevant obligation.\n\nShort-term deposit ratings may be adjusted for loss severity.\n\nShort-term ratings are assigned to obligations whose initial maturity is viewed as \u201cshort term\u201d based on market convention.\n\nTypically, this means up to 13 months for corporate, sovereign, and structured obligations and up to 36 months for obligations in U.S. public finance markets.\n\nAn F1 rating indicates the strongest\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nintrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments whereas an F2 rating indicates good intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.\n\nZero Coupons, Pay-In-Kind Securities or Deferred Payment Securities.", "Zero coupon, pay-in-kind and deferred payment securities are all types of fixed-income securities on which the holder does not receive periodic cash payments of interest or principal.\n\nGenerally, these securities are subject to greater price volatility and lesser liquidity in the event of adverse market conditions than comparably rated securities paying cash interest at regular intervals.\n\nAlthough a Fund will not receive cash periodic coupon payments on these securities, the Fund may be deemed to have received interest income, or \u201cphantom income\u201d during the life of the obligation.\n\nThe Fund may have to distribute such phantom income to avoid taxes at the Fund level, although it has not received any cash payment.\n\nZero Coupons.\n\nZero coupons are fixed-income securities that do not make regular interest payments.\n\nInstead, zero coupons are sold at a discount from their face value.", "The difference between a zero coupon\u2019s issue or purchase price and its face value represents the imputed interest an investor will earn if the obligation is held until maturity.\n\nFor tax purposes, a portion of this imputed interest is deemed as income received by zero coupon bondholders each year.\n\nEach Fund intends to pass along such interest as a component of the Fund\u2019s distributions of net investment income.\n\nZero coupons may offer investors the opportunity to earn a higher yield than that available on ordinary interest-paying obligations of similar credit quality and maturity.\n\nHowever, zero coupon prices may also exhibit greater price volatility than ordinary fixed-income securities because of the manner in which their principal and interest are returned to the investor.\n\nPay-In-Kind Securities.\n\nPay-in-kind securities are securities that have interest payable by delivery of additional securities.\n\nUpon maturity, the holder is entitled to receive the aggregate par value of the securities.", "Deferred Payment Securities.\n\nDeferred payment securities are securities that remain zero coupons until a predetermined date, at which time the stated coupon rate becomes effective and interest becomes payable at regular intervals.\n\nSpecial Purpose Acquisition Companies.\n\nThe Fund may invest in stock, warrants, rights and other securities of special purpose acquisition companies (\u201cSPAC\u201d), which typically are publicly traded companies that raise investment capital for the purpose of acquiring or merging with an existing company that is identified subsequent to the SPAC\u2019s initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d), or similar special purpose entities.\n\nTypically, the acquisition target is an existing privately held company that wants to trade publicly, which it accomplishes through a combination with a SPAC rather than by conducting a traditional IPO.\n\nSPACs and similar entities are blank check companies and do not have any operating history or ongoing business other than seeking acquisitions.", "The long term value of a SPAC\u2019s securities is particularly dependent on the ability of the SPAC\u2019s management to identify a merger target and complete an attractive acquisition.\n\nSome SPACs pursue acquisitions only within certain sectors, industries or regions, which may increase the time horizon for an acquisition as well as other risks associated with these investments, including price volatility.\n\nConversely, other SPACs may invest without such limitations, in which case the SPAC\u2019s management may have limited experience or knowledge of the market sector, industry or region in which the transaction is contemplated.\n\nIn addition, certain securities issued by a SPAC, particularly in private placements conducted by the SPAC after its IPO, may be classified as illiquid and/or be subject to restrictions on resale, which restrictions may be imposed for at least a year or possibly a more extended time, and may potentially be traded only in the over-the-counter market.", "Until an acquisition or merger is completed, a SPAC generally invests its assets, less a portion retained to cover expenses, in U.S. government securities, money market securities and cash and does not typically pay dividends in respect of its common stock.\n\nTo the extent a SPAC is invested in these securities or cash, the SPAC may not perform similar to other equity securities and this may impact the Fund\u2019s ability to meet its investment objective.\n\nSPAC shareholders may not approve any proposed acquisition or merger, or an acquisition or merger, once effected, may prove unsuccessful.\n\nIf an acquisition or merger that meets the requirements of the SPAC is not completed within a pre-established period of time (typically, two years), the funds invested in the SPAC plus any interest paid on such funds while held in trust (less any permitted expenses and any losses experienced by the SPAC) are returned to its shareholders, unless the shareholders approve alternative options.", "As a result, the Fund may be subject to opportunity costs to the extent that alternative investments would have produced higher returns.\n\nAny warrants or other rights with respect to a SPAC held by the Fund may expire worthless or may be repurchased or retired by the SPAC at an unfavorable price.\n\nIn connection with a proposed acquisition, a SPAC may raise additional funds in order to fund the acquisition, post-acquisition working capital, redemptions or some combination of those purposes.\n\nThis additional fundraising may be in the form of a private placement of a class of equity securities or debt.\n\nThe debt could be secured by the assets of the SPAC or the operating company existing after the acquisition or it could be unsecured.\n\nThe debt may also be investment grade debt or below investment grade debt.\n\nThe Fund may invest in stock, warrants, rights and other securities of SPACs or similar special purpose entities in a private placement transaction or as part of a public offering.", "If the Fund purchases securities in the SPAC\u2019s IPO, typically it will receive publicly-traded securities called \u201cunits\u201d that include one share of common stock and one right or warrant (or partial right or warrant) conveying the right to purchase additional shares of common stock.\n\nAt a specified time, the rights and warrants may be separated from the common\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nstock at the election of the holder, after which each security typically is freely tradeable.\n\nAn investment in the IPO securities of a SPAC may be diluted by additional, later offerings of securities by the SPAC or by other investors exercising existing rights to purchase securities of the SPAC.", "If the Fund invests in equity securities issued in a private placement after the IPO, those shares will not be publicly tradable unless and until there is a registration statement filed by the SPAC and approved by the SEC or if an exemption from registration is available, which exemptions typically become available at least a year after the date of the business combination.\n\nEquity investments in the SPAC made in connection with a proposed business combination will be diluted by the acquisition itself and further fundraising by the ongoing operating business.\n\nIf there is no market for the shares of the SPAC or only a thinly traded market for shares or interests in the SPAC develops, the Fund may not be able to sell its interest in a SPAC or it may only sell its interest at a price below what the Fund believes is the SPAC interest\u2019s value.", "If not subject to a restriction on resale, the Fund may sell its investments in a SPAC at any time, including before, at or after the time of an acquisition or merger.\n\nGenerally, SPACs provide the opportunity for common shareholders who hold publicly traded shares to have some or all of their shares redeemed by the SPAC at or around the time of a proposed acquisition or merger.\n\nHowever, there is often a limit to the number of shares that can be redeemed in connection with a business combination.\n\nIf the Fund holds shares of publicly traded SPAC stock, this means that the Fund may not be able to redeem those shares prior to an acquisition and may have to hold those shares until after the completion of the acquisition.\n\nIf the Fund purchases shares in a private placement, those shares will not be redeemable in connection with a transaction.", "In addition, the Fund may elect not to participate in a proposed SPAC transaction or may be required to divest its interests in the SPAC due to regulatory or other considerations.\n\nAn investment in a SPAC is subject to the risks that any proposed acquisition or merger may not obtain the requisite approval of SPAC shareholders, may require governmental or other approvals that it fails to obtain or that an acquisition or merger, once effected, may prove unsuccessful and lose value.\n\nIn addition, among other conflicts of interest, the economic interests of the management, directors, officers and related parties of a SPAC can differ from the economic interests of public shareholders, which may lead to conflicts as they evaluate, negotiate and recommend business combination transactions to shareholders.\n\nThis risk may become more acute as the deadline for the completion of a business combination nears or in the event that attractive acquisition or merger targets become scarce.", "An investment in a SPAC is subject to the risks that any proposed acquisition or merger may not obtain the requisite approval of SPAC shareholders, may require governmental or other approvals that it fails to obtain or that an acquisition or merger, once effected, may prove unsuccessful and lose value.\n\nIn addition, among other conflicts of interest, the economic interests of the management, directors, officers and related parties of a SPAC can differ from the economic interests of public shareholders, which may lead to conflicts as they evaluate, negotiate and recommend business combination transactions to shareholders.\n\nFor example, because the sponsor, directors and officers of a SPAC may directly or indirectly own interests in a SPAC, the sponsor, directors and officers may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate a business combination.", "SPAC sponsors generally purchase equity in the SPAC at more favorable terms than investors in the IPO or subsequent investors on the open market.\n\nAs a result, although most of the SPAC\u2019s capital has been provided by IPO investors, the sponsors and potentially other initial investors will benefit more than investors from the SPAC\u2019s completion of an initial business combination and may have an incentive to complete a transaction on terms that may be less favorable to other investors.\n\nThis risk may become more acute as the deadline for the completion of a business combination nears or in the event that attractive acquisition or merger targets become scarce.", "In addition, the requirement that a SPAC complete a business combination within a prescribed time frame may give potential target businesses leverage over the SPAC in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time the SPAC has in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, which could undermine the SPAC\u2019s ability to complete a business combination on terms that would produce value for its shareholders.\n\nAn investment in a SPAC is also subject to the risk that a significant portion of the funds raised by the SPAC may be expended during the search for a target acquisition or merger.\n\nThe value of investments in SPACs may be highly volatile and may depreciate over time.", "In addition, investments in SPACs may be subject to the same risks as investing in any initial public offering, including the risks associated with companies that have little operating history as public companies, including unseasoned trading, small number of shares available for trading and limited information about the issuer.\n\nIn addition, the market for IPO issuers may be volatile, and share prices of newly-public companies have fluctuated significantly over short periods of time.\n\nAlthough some IPOs may produce high returns, such returns are not typical and may not be sustainable.\n\nCertain investments in SPACs are privately placed securities and are also subject to the risks of such securities.\n\nBitcoin Exposure.\n\nThe Fund may have exposure to bitcoin indirectly through cash settled futures or indirectly through investments in pooled investment vehicles and exchange-traded products that invest in bitcoin (\u201cBitcoin ETFs\u201d).", "To the extent the Fund invests in bitcoin futures or Bitcoin ETFs, it will do so through a wholly-owned subsidiary, which is organized as an exempted company under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the \u201cBitcoin Subsidiary\u201d or \u201cSubsidiary\u201d).\n\nThe Fund may at times have no exposure to bitcoin.\n\nAlthough the Fund does not directly invest in bitcoin, the Fund\u2019s indirect investments in bitcoin are exposed to risks associated with the price of bitcoin, which is subject to numerous factors and risks.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nBitcoin is a digital asset whose ownership and behavior are determined by participants in an online, peer-to-peer network that connects computers that run publicly accessible, or \u201copen source,\u201d software that follows the rules and procedures governing the bitcoin network (commonly referred to as the bitcoin protocol).\n\nThe value of bitcoin, like the value of other cryptocurrencies, is not backed by any government, corporation, or other identified body.", "The value of bitcoin is determined in part by the supply of (which is limited), and demand for, bitcoin in the markets for exchange that have been organized to facilitate the trading of bitcoin.\n\nThe further development of the bitcoin network, which is part of a new and rapidly changing industry, is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate.\n\nRisks Related to Bitcoin.\n\nCryptocurrencies (also referred to as \u201cvirtual currencies\u201d and \u201cdigital currencies\u201d) are digital assets designed to act as a medium of exchange.\n\nAlthough there are thousands of cryptocurrencies, the most well-known of which is bitcoin.\n\nCryptocurrency is an emerging asset class with a limited history.\n\nInvestments in or exposure to bitcoin are subject to substantial risks, including significant price volatility and fraud and manipulation, which are generally more pronounced in the crypto asset market.", "In addition, performance and value of indirect investments in bitcoin may differ significantly from the performance or value of bitcoin.\n\nCryptocurrency facilitates decentralized, peer-to-peer financial exchange and value storage that is used like money, without the oversight of a central authority or banks.\n\nThe value of cryptocurrency is not backed by any government, corporation, or other identified body.\n\nSimilar to fiat currencies (i.e., a currency that is backed by a central bank or a national, supra-national or quasi-national organization), cryptocurrencies are susceptible to theft, loss and destruction.\n\nFor example, the bitcoin held by Bitcoin ETFs (and the Fund\u2019s indirect exposure to such bitcoin) is also susceptible to these risks.\n\nThe value of the Fund\u2019s indirect investments in bitcoin is subject to significant fluctuations in the value of the cryptocurrency, which have been and may in the future be highly volatile and subject to sharp declines.", "The value of cryptocurrencies is determined by the supply and demand for cryptocurrency in the global market for the trading of cryptocurrency, which consists primarily of transactions on electronic exchanges.\n\nThe price of bitcoin could drop precipitously (including to zero) for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, regulatory changes, a crisis of confidence, flaw or operational issue in the bitcoin network or a change in user preference to competing cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s exposure to bitcoin could result in substantial losses to the Fund.\n\nCryptocurrencies trade on exchanges, which are largely unregulated and, therefore, are more exposed to fraud, market manipulation and failure than established, regulated exchanges for securities and other traditional assets, derivatives, and other currencies.", "Cryptocurrency exchanges have in the past, and may in the future, fail or otherwise cease operating temporarily or even permanently, resulting in the potential loss of users\u2019 cryptocurrency or other market disruptions.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges that are regulated typically must comply with minimum net capital, cybersecurity, and anti-money laundering requirements, but are not typically required to protect customers or their markets to the same extent that regulated securities exchanges or futures exchanges are required to do so.\n\nFurthermore, many cryptocurrency exchanges lack certain safeguards established by traditional exchanges to enhance the stability of trading on the exchange, such as measures designed to prevent sudden drops in value of items traded on the exchange (i.e., \u201cflash crashes\u201d).\n\nAs a result, the prices of cryptocurrencies on exchanges may be subject to larger and more frequent sudden declines than assets traded on traditional exchanges.", "In addition, cryptocurrency exchanges are also subject to the risk of cybersecurity threats and have been breached, resulting in the theft and/or loss of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nA cyber or other security breach or a business failure of a cryptocurrency exchange or custodian may affect the price of a particular cryptocurrency or cryptocurrencies generally.\n\nA risk also exists with respect to malicious actors or previously unknown vulnerabilities, which may adversely affect the value of bitcoin.\n\nDisruptions at bitcoin exchanges and potential consequences of a bitcoin exchange\u2019s failure could adversely affect the Fund\u2019s indirect investments in bitcoin.\n\nIn 2022 and early 2023, several large participants in the cryptocurrency industry, including exchanges, lenders and investment firms, declared bankruptcy, which has resulted in a loss of confidence in participants of the digital asset ecosystem and negative publicity surrounding digital assets more broadly.", "These events have also contributed to financial distress among crypto asset market participants and widespread disruption in those markets.\n\nThe collateral impacts of these types of failures, or of fraud or other adverse developments in the crypto asset markets, is difficult to predict.\n\nExtreme volatility in the future, including further declines in the trading prices of the bitcoin, could have a material adverse effect on the value of the Fund\u2019s indirect investments in bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, negative perception and/or a lack of stability and standardized regulation in the digital asset economy may reduce confidence in the digital asset economy and may result in greater volatility in the prices of bitcoin and other digital assets, including a depreciation in value.\n\nFurther, regulation of crypto asset markets is still developing and federal, state or foreign governmental authorities may restrict the development, use or exchange or cryptocurrencies.", "In addition, events that impact one cryptocurrency may lead to a volatility or a decline in the value or another cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin.\n\nThe market for bitcoin (and bitcoin futures) depends on, among other things: the supply and demand for bitcoin (and bitcoin futures); the adoption of bitcoin for commercial uses; the anticipated increase of investments in bitcoin-related investment products by retail and institutional investors; speculative interest in bitcoin, bitcoin futures, and bitcoin-related investment products; regulatory or other restrictions on investors\u2019 ability to invest in bitcoin futures; and the potential ability to hedge against the price of bitcoin with bitcoin futures (and vice versa).\n\nAt times, there has been, and may in the future be, significant disruption to the crypto asset market, which could adversely impact the Fund\u2019s indirect investments in bitcoin.\n\nBack to Table of Contents", "Factors affecting the further development of cryptocurrency include, but are not limited to: continued worldwide growth or possible cessation or reversal in the adoption and use of cryptocurrency and other digital assets; government and quasi-government regulation or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of digital asset networks; changes in consumer demographics and public preferences; maintenance and development of open-source software protocol; availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services; the use of the networks supporting digital assets, such as those for developing smart contracts and distributed applications; general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to digital assets; negative consumer or public perception; and general risks tied to the use of information technologies, including cyber risks.", "A breach or failure of one cryptocurrency may lead to a loss in confidence in, and thus decreased usage and or value of, other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin mining operations consume significant amounts of electricity, which may have a negative environmental impact and give rise to public opinion against allowing, or government regulations restricting, the use of electricity for mining operations.\n\nAdditionally, miners may be forced to cease operations during an electricity shortage or power outage.\n\nGiven the energy-intensiveness and electricity costs of mining, miners are restricted in where they can locate mining operations.\n\nAny shortage of electricity supply or increase in related costs (or if miners otherwise cease expanding processing power) will negatively impact the viability and expected economic return from bitcoin mining, which will affect the availability of bitcoin in the marketplace.\n\nToday, many bitcoin mining operations rely on fossil fuels to power their operations.", "Public perception of the impact of bitcoin mining on climate change may reduce the demand for bitcoin and increase the likelihood of government regulation.\n\nSuch events could have a negative impact on the price of bitcoin, bitcoin futures, and the Fund\u2019s performance.\n\nIn addition, sales of newly mined bitcoin (and sales of bitcoin by large holders) may impact the price of bitcoin.\n\nCurrently, there is relatively limited use of cryptocurrency in the retail and commercial marketplace, which contributes to price volatility.\n\nA lack of expansion by cryptocurrencies into retail and commercial markets, or a contraction of such use, may result in increased volatility or a reduction in the value of cryptocurrencies, either of which could adversely impact the Fund\u2019s indirect investment in bitcoin.\n\nIn addition, to the extent market participants develop a preference for one cryptocurrency over another, the value of the less preferred cryptocurrency would likely be adversely affected.", "Cryptocurrency is a new technological innovation with a limited history; it is a highly speculative asset and future U.S. or foreign government or regulatory actions or policies may limit, perhaps to a materially adverse extent, the value of the Fund\u2019s indirect investment in bitcoin and the ability to exchange a cryptocurrency or utilize it for payments.\n\nMany significant aspects of the tax treatment of investments in cryptocurrency are uncertain, and a direct or indirect investment in cryptocurrency may produce income that if directly earned by a RIC, like the Fund, would be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of the income test applicable to RICs.\n\nAccordingly, to the extent the Fund invests in bitcoin futures or Bitcoin ETFs, it will do so through its Subsidiary.", "In 2014, the IRS released a notice (the \u201cNotice\u201d) discussing certain aspects of \u201cconvertible virtual currency\u201d (that is, digital assets that have an equivalent value in fiat currency or that act as a substitute for fiat currency) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, in particular, stating that such a digital asset (i) is \u201cproperty,\u201d (ii) is not \u201ccurrency\u201d for purposes of the rules relating to foreign currency gain or loss and (iii) may be held as a capital asset.\n\nIn 2019, the IRS released a revenue ruling and a set of \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d (the \u201cRuling & FAQs\u201d) that provide some additional guidance.\n\nHowever, the Notice and the Ruling & FAQs do not address other significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of digital assets.", "Moreover, although the Ruling & FAQs address the treatment of hard forks, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to the income and withholding taxation of incidental rights received through a fork in the blockchain, airdrops offered to bitcoin holders and other similar events, including situations where such rights are disclaimed, as is expected with respect to a Bitcoin ETF\u2019s intended treatment of such events.\n\nThe taxing authorities of certain states (i) have announced that they will follow the Notice with respect to the treatment of digital assets for state income tax purposes and/or (ii) have issued guidance exempting the purchase and/or sale of digital assets for fiat currency from state sales tax.\n\nIt is unclear what further guidance on the treatment of digital assets for state tax purposes may be issued in the future.\n\nBecause of the evolving nature of digital assets, it is not possible to predict potential future developments that may arise with respect to digital assets.", "Any future guidance on the treatment of digital assets for federal, state or local tax purposes could result in adverse tax consequences for investors in the Fund and could have an adverse effect on the value of bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Cash Settled Futures.\n\nThe Fund may engage in futures contracts based on bitcoin.\n\nThe only bitcoin futures in which the Fund may invest are cash settled bitcoin futures traded on futures exchanges registered with the CFTC.\n\nThe value of bitcoin futures is determined by reference to the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate, which provides an indication of the price of bitcoin across certain cash bitcoin exchanges.\n\nBitcoin futures expose the Fund to all of the risks related to bitcoin discussed above and also expose the Fund to risks related to futures, and specifically risks related to bitcoin futures.\n\nThe price of bitcoin futures is based on a variety of factors.", "For example, regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in bitcoin futures or restrict the use of bitcoin or the operations of\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nthe bitcoin network or exchanges on which bitcoin trades in a manner that adversely affects the price of bitcoin futures, which could adversely impact the Fund and necessitate the payment of large daily variation margin payments to settle the Fund\u2019s losses.\n\nThe market for bitcoin futures is still developing and the Fund\u2019s investment in bitcoin futures may involve illiquidity risk, as bitcoin futures are not as heavily traded as other futures given that the bitcoin futures market is relatively new, which means the Fund may be unable to purchase or sell a futures contract at a desired price or time.", "In addition, bitcoin futures markets may be more volatile than traditional futures markets and exchanges on which bitcoin futures are traded and their related clearinghouses and the Fund\u2019s FCMs generally require the Fund to maintain relatively high levels of initial margin at the clearinghouse and FCM in connection with bitcoin futures.\n\nInitial margin requirements will increase if the Fund\u2019s bitcoin futures investments increase in value.\n\nBitcoin futures are subject to collateral requirements and daily limits that may limit the Fund\u2019s ability to achieve the desired exposure.\n\nExchanges on which bitcoin is traded (which are the source of the price(s) used to determine the cash settlement amount for the Fund\u2019s bitcoin futures) have experienced, and may in the future experience, technical and operational issues, making bitcoin prices unavailable at times.", "In addition, the cash market in bitcoin has been the target of fraud and manipulation, which could affect the pricing of bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nThe contractual obligations of a buyer or seller holding a futures contract to expiration may be satisfied by settling in cash as provided by the terms of such contract.\n\nHowever, the Fund does not intend to hold bitcoin futures through expiration.\n\nInstead, the Fund intends to \u201croll\u201d futures positions.\n\n\u201cRolling\u201d refers to a process whereby futures contracts nearing expiration are closed out and replaced with new futures contracts with a later expiration date.\n\nAccordingly, the Fund is subject to risks related to rolling.\n\nIn addition, the costs associated with rolling bitcoin futures typically are substantially higher than the costs associated with other futures contracts and may have a significant adverse impact on the performance of the Fund\u2019s investments in bitcoin futures.", "When the market for certain futures contracts is such that the prices are higher in the more distant delivery months than in the nearer delivery months, the sale during the \u201crolling process\u201d of the bitcoin futures with closer delivery dates would take place at a price that is lower than the price of the bitcoin futures with more distant delivery dates.\n\nThis pattern of higher futures prices for longer expiration bitcoin futures is often referred to as \u201ccontango.\u201d\n\nAlternatively, when the market for certain bitcoin futures is such that the prices are higher in the nearer months than in the more distant months, the sale during the rolling process of the more nearby bitcoin futures would take place at a price that is higher than the price of the more distant bitcoin futures.\n\nThis pattern of higher future prices for shorter expiration bitcoin futures is referred to as \u201cbackwardation.\u201d", "There have been extended periods in which contango or backwardation has existed in certain futures markets in general.\n\nSuch periods could occur in the future for bitcoin futures and may cause significant and sustained losses.\n\nAdditionally, because of the frequency with which the Fund may roll futures contracts, the impact of contango or backwardation on Fund performance may be greater than it would have been if the Fund rolled futures contracts less frequently.\n\nIn addition, bitcoin and bitcoin futures have generally exhibited significant price volatility relative to traditional asset classes.\n\nBitcoin futures may also experience significant price volatility as a result of the market fraud and manipulation noted above.\n\nFutures contracts based on bitcoin are also subject to the risks otherwise applicable to derivatives, in particular those described in \u201cFutures Contracts.\u201d\n\nBitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe Fund may obtain investment

other laws; regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs; and/or additional compliance costs.\n\nThe Trust may incur additional costs for cyber security risk management and remediation purposes.\n\nIn addition, cyber security risks may also impact issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, which may cause the Fund\u2019s investment in such issuers to lose value.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Trust or its service providers will not suffer losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches in the future.\n\nRegulatory and Legal Risk.", "U.S. and non-U.S. governmental agencies and other regulators regularly implement additional regulations and legislators pass new laws that affect the investments held by the Fund, the strategies used by the Fund or the level of regulation or taxation applying to the Fund (such as regulations related to investments in derivatives and other transactions).\n\nThese regulations and laws impact the investment strategies, performance, costs and operations of the Fund or taxation of shareholders.\n\nFor example, the SEC recently adopted amendments to rules related to fund names and related strategies, which could result in costs to some Funds in amending their names and/or strategies accordingly.\n\nIn addition, a rapidly expanding or otherwise more aggressive regulatory environment may impose greater costs on all sectors and on financial services companies in particular.\n\nMarket and Geopolitical Risk.\n\nThe value of your investment in the Fund is based on the values of the Fund\u2019s investments.", "These values change daily due to economic and other events that affect markets generally, as well as those that affect particular regions, countries, industries, companies or governments.\n\nPrice movements, sometimes called volatility, may be greater or less depending on the types of securities the Fund owns and the markets in which the securities trade.\n\nThe increasing interconnectivity between global economies and markets increases the likelihood that events or conditions in one region, sector, industry, market or with respect to one company may adversely impact issuers in a different country, region, sector, industry, or market.\n\nFor example, adverse developments in the banking or financial

events, such as war, natural disasters, health emergencies (e.g., epidemics and pandemics), terrorism, conflicts, social unrest, recessions, inflation, rapid interest rate changes and supply chain disruptions may occur and could significantly impact issuers, industries, governments and other systems, including the financial markets.\n\nAs global\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nsystems,

disruption.\n\nThe extent and nature of the impact on supply chains or economies and markets from these events is unknown, particularly if a health emergency or other similar event persists for an extended period of time.", "Social, political, economic and other conditions and events, such as natural disasters, health emergencies (e.g., epidemics and pandemics), terrorism, conflicts, social unrest, recessions, inflation, rapid interest rate changes and supply chain disruption could reduce consumer demand or economic output, result in market closures, travel restrictions or quarantines, and generally have a significant impact on the economies and financial markets and the Adviser\u2019s investment advisory activities and services of other service providers, which in turn could adversely affect the Fund\u2019s investments and other operations.\n\nThe value of the Fund\u2019s investment may decrease as a result of such events, particularly if these events adversely impact the operations and effectiveness of the Adviser or key service providers or if these events disrupt systems and processes necessary or beneficial to the investment advisory or other activities on behalf of the Fund.", "Additionally, health crises and geopolitical developments have in the past caused, and may in the future cause, disruption in supply chains, and adversely impacted a number of

performance of the Fund\u2019s investments may be impacted adversely.\n\nDuring periods of low interest rates, the Fund\u2019s susceptibility to interest rate risk (i.e., the risks associated with changes in interest rates) may be magnified, its yield and income may be diminished and its performance may be adversely affected (e.g., during periods of low interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain positive returns).\n\nThese levels of interest rates may magnify the risks associated with rising interest rates.\n\nChanging interest rates may have unpredictable effects on markets, including market volatility and reduced liquidity, and may adversely affect the Fund\u2019s yield, income and performance.\n\nGovernment and other public debt can be adversely affected by large and sudden changes in local and global economic conditions that result in increased debt levels.", "Although high levels of government and other public debt do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, high levels of debt may create certain systemic risks if sound debt management practices are not implemented.\n\nA high debt level may increase market pressures to meet an issuer\u2019s funding needs, which may increase borrowing costs and cause a government or public or municipal entity to issue additional debt, thereby increasing the risk of refinancing.\n\nA high debt level also raises concerns that the issuer may be unable or unwilling to repay the principal or interest on its debt, which may adversely impact instruments held by the Fund that rely on such payments.\n\nGovernmental and quasi-governmental responses to certain economic or other conditions may lead to increasing government and other public debt, which heighten these risks.", "Unsustainable debt levels can lead to declines in the value of currency, and can prevent a government from implementing effective counter-cyclical fiscal policy during economic downturns, can generate or contribute to an economic downturn or cause other adverse economic or market developments, such as increases in inflation or volatility.\n\nIncreasing government and other public debt may adversely affect issuers, obligors, guarantors or instruments across a variety of asset classes.\n\nESG Investment Risk.\n\nTo the extent that the Adviser considers environmental, social and/or governance (\u201cESG\u201d) issues, the Fund\u2019s performance may be impacted.\n\nAdditionally, the Adviser\u2019s consideration of ESG issues may require subjective analysis based on qualitative assessments and the ability of the Adviser to consider ESG issues may be impacted by data availability for a particular company or issuer (or obligor), including if the data is inaccurate, incomplete, unavailable or based on estimates.", "The Adviser\u2019s consideration of ESG issues may contribute to the Adviser\u2019s decision to forgo opportunities to buy certain securities.\n\nESG issues with respect to an issuer (or obligor) or the Adviser\u2019s assessment of such may change over time.\n\nThe consideration of ESG issues within the Adviser\u2019s investment decision-making process for a Fund may vary across asset classes, industries and sectors.\n\nFor certain Funds, ESG issues are not necessarily considered with respect to each issuer (or obligor) in which the Funds invest and are not the sole determinant of whether or not an investment can be made or a holding can remain in the Funds\u2019 portfolios.\n\nAs a result, the Funds may, in some cases, invest in companies or issuers that do not have favorable sustainability or ESG characteristics.\n\nFund Policies/Investment Restrictions\n\nThe investment objective, policies and restrictions listed below have been adopted by the Fund as fundamental policies.", "Under the 1940 Act, a fundamental policy may not be changed without the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nThe 1940 Act defines a majority as the lesser of (a) 67% or more of the shares present at a meeting of shareholders, if the holders of 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are present or represented by proxy; or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund.\n\nFor purposes of the following restrictions: (i) all percentage limitations apply immediately after a purchase or initial investment, except in the case of borrowing and investments in illiquid securities; and (ii) any subsequent change in any applicable percentage resulting from market fluctuations or other changes in total or net assets does not require elimination of any security from the portfolio, except in the case of borrowings.\n\nThe Fund will:\n\n1\\. Seek long-term capital appreciation.\n\nThe Fund will not:", "1\\. Invest in a manner inconsistent with its classification as a \u201cdiversified company\u201d as provided by (i) the 1940 Act, as amended from time to time, (ii) the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the 1940 Act, as amended from time to time, or (iii) an exemption or other relief applicable to the Fund from the provisions of the 1940 Act, as amended from time to time.\n\n2\\.

Make loans of money or property to any person, except (a) to the extent that securities or interests in that the Fund may invest are considered to be loans, (b) through the loan of portfolio securities, (c) by engaging in repurchase agreements or (d) as may otherwise be permitted by (i) the 1940 Act, as amended from time to time, (ii) the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the 1940 Act, as amended from time to time, or (iii) an exemption or other relief applicable to the Fund from the provisions of the 1940 Act, as amended from time to time.", "4\\. Purchase or sell physical commodities unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments; provided that this restriction shall not prohibit the Fund from purchasing or selling options, futures contracts and related options thereon, forward contracts, swaps, caps, floors, collars and any other financial instruments or from investing in securities or other instruments backed by physical commodities or as otherwise permitted by (i) the 1940 Act, as amended from time to time, (ii) the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the 1940 Act, as amended from time to time, or (iii) an exemption or other relief applicable to the Fund from the provisions of the 1940 Act, as amended from time to time.", "5\\.

Purchase or sell real estate or interests therein (including limited partnership interests), although the Fund may purchase securities of issuers which engage in real estate operations and securities secured by real estate or interests therein.", "8\\. Engage in the underwriting of securities, except insofar as the Fund may be deemed an underwriter under the 1933 Act in disposing of a portfolio security.\n\nIn addition, as non-fundamental policies, which can be changed with Board approval and without shareholder vote, the Fund will not:\n\n1\\. Invest its assets in the securities of any investment company except as may be permitted by (i) the 1940 Act, as amended from time to time; (ii) the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the 1940 Act, as amended from time to time; or (iii) an exemption or other relief applicable to the Fund from the provisions of the 1940 Act, as amended from time to time.\n\nThe Fund has an operating policy, which may be changed by the Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees, not to borrow except from a bank for temporary or emergency purposes in amounts not exceeding 5% (taken at the lower of cost or current value) of its total assets (not including the amount borrowed).", "The investment policies, limitations or practices of the Fund may not apply during periods of unusual or adverse market, economic, political or other conditions.\n\nSuch market, economic, political or other conditions may include periods of abnormal or heightened market volatility, strained credit and/or liquidity conditions or increased governmental intervention in the markets or industries.\n\nDuring such periods, the Fund may not invest according to its principal investment strategies or in the manner in which its name may suggest, and may be subject to different and/or heightened risks.\n\nIt is possible that such unusual or adverse conditions may continue for extended periods of time.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nDisclosure of Portfolio Holdings\n\nThe Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees and the Adviser have adopted policies and procedures regarding disclosure of portfolio holdings (the \u201cPolicy\u201d).", "Pursuant to the Policy, the Adviser may disclose information concerning Fund portfolio holdings only if such disclosure is consistent with the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and the Fund\u2019s and the Adviser\u2019s fiduciary duties to Fund shareholders.\n\nIn no instance may the Adviser or the Fund receive compensation or any other consideration in connection with the disclosure of information about the portfolio securities of the Fund.\n\nConsideration includes any agreement to maintain assets in the Fund or in other investment companies or accounts managed by the Adviser or by any affiliated person of the Adviser.\n\nNon-public information concerning portfolio holdings may be divulged to third-parties only when the Fund has a legitimate business purpose for doing so and the recipients of the information are subject to a duty of confidentiality.", "Under no circumstances shall current or prospective Fund shareholders receive non-public portfolio holdings information, except as described below.\n\nThe Fund makes available on its public website the following portfolio holdings information:\n\n\u25a0 |  complete portfolio holdings information quarterly, at least 45 calendar days after the end of each quarter; and\n\n\u25a0 |  top 10 holdings monthly, at least 15 calendar days after the end of each month.\n\nThe Fund provides a complete schedule of portfolio holdings for the second and fourth fiscal quarters in its Semi-Annual and Annual reports, and for the first and third fiscal quarters in its filings with the SEC as an exhibit to Form N-PORT.\n\nThese portfolio holdings are also available on the Fund\u2019s public website [https://www.morganstanley.com/im/shareholderreports](DUMMY_15902_2_3)\n\nThe Company may provide publicly, portfolio holdings information more frequently if it has a legitimate business purpose for doing so.", "All other portfolio holdings information that has not been disseminated in a manner making it available generally as described above is non-public information for purposes of the Policy.\n\nThe Fund may make selective disclosure of non-public portfolio holdings information pursuant to certain exemptions set forth in the Policy.\n\nThird-parties eligible for exemptions under the Policy and therefore eligible to receive such disclosures currently include clients/shareholders (such as redeeming shareholders in-kind), fund rating agencies, information exchange subscribers, proxy voting or advisory services, pricing services, consultants and analysts, portfolio analytics providers, transition managers and service providers, provided that the third party expressly agrees to maintain the disclosed information in confidence and not to trade portfolio securities or related derivative securities based on the non-public information.", "Non-public portfolio holdings information may not be disclosed to a third-party pursuant to an exemption unless and until the third-party recipient has entered into a non-disclosure agreement with the Fund and the arrangement has been reviewed and approved, as set forth in the Policy and discussed below.\n\nIn addition, persons who owe a duty of trust or confidence to the Fund or the Adviser may receive non-public portfolio holdings information without entering into a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nCurrently, these persons include (i) the Fund\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm (as of the Fund\u2019s fiscal year-end and on an as-needed basis), (ii) counsel to the Fund (on an as-needed basis), (iii) counsel to the Independent Trustees (on an as-needed basis) and (iv) members of the Board of Trustees (on an as-needed basis).", "Subject to the terms and conditions of any agreement between the Adviser or the Fund and the third-party recipient, if these conditions for disclosure are satisfied, there shall be no restriction on the frequency with which Fund non-public portfolio holdings information is released, and no lag period shall apply (unless otherwise indicated below).", "The Adviser may provide interest lists to broker-dealers who execute securities transactions for the Fund without entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the broker-dealers, provided that the interest list satisfies all of the following criteria: (1) the interest list must contain only the CUSIP numbers and/or ticker symbols of securities held in all Morgan Stanley Funds on an aggregate, rather than a fund-by-fund basis; (2) the interest list will not disclose portfolio holdings on a fund-by-fund basis; (3) the interest list must not contain information about the number or value of shares owned by a specified Morgan Stanley Fund; (4) the interest list may identify the investment strategy, but not the particular Morgan Stanley Funds, to which the list relates; and (5) the interest list may not identify the portfolio manager or team members responsible for managing the Morgan Stanley Funds.", "The Fund may discuss or otherwise disclose performance attribution analyses (i.e., mention the effects of having a particular security in the portfolio(s)) where such discussion is not contemporaneously made public, provided that the particular holding has been disclosed publicly or the information that includes such holding(s) has been made available to shareholders requesting such information.\n\nAdditionally, any discussion of the analyses may not be more current than the date the holding was disclosed publicly or the information that includes such holding(s) has been made available to shareholders requesting such information.", "Portfolio holdings information may be provided to broker-dealers, prime brokers, futures commission merchants, or similar providers in connection with the Fund\u2019s portfolio trading or operational processing activities; such entities generally need access to such information in the performance of their duties and responsibilities to fund service providers and are subject to a duty of confidentiality, including a duty not to trade on material non-public information, imposed by law or contract.\n\nPortfolio holdings information may also be provided to affiliates of Morgan Stanley Investment Management (\u201cMSIM\u201d) pursuant to regulatory\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nrequirements or for legitimate business purposes, which may include risk management, or may be reported by the Fund\u2019s counterparties to certain global trade repositories pursuant to regulatory requirements.", "The Adviser and/or the Fund

forth in the Policy must be reviewed and approved by the Adviser, which will also determine from time-to-time whether such third-parties should continue to receive portfolio holdings information.\n\nThe Adviser shall report quarterly to the Board of Trustees (or a designated committee thereof) at the next regularly scheduled meeting: (i) any material information concerning all parties receiving non-public portfolio holdings information pursuant to an exemption; and (ii) any new non-disclosure agreements entered into during the reporting period.", "Procedures to monitor the use of such non-public portfolio holdings information may include requiring annual certifications that the recipients have utilized such information only pursuant to the terms of the agreement between the recipient and the Adviser and, for those recipients receiving information electronically, acceptance of the information will constitute reaffirmation that the third-party expressly agrees to maintain the disclosed information in confidence and not to trade portfolio securities based on the non-public information.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF THE FUND\n\nBoard of Trustees\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe Board of Trustees of the Fund oversees the management of the Fund, but does not itself manage the Fund.\n\nThe Trustees review various services provided by or under the direction of the Adviser to ensure that the Fund\u2019s general investment policies and programs are properly carried out.", "The Trustees also conduct their review to ensure that administrative services are provided to the Fund in a satisfactory manner.\n\nUnder state law, the duties of the Trustees are generally characterized as a duty of loyalty and a duty of care.\n\nThe duty of loyalty requires a Trustee to exercise his or her powers in the interest of the Fund and not the Trustee\u2019s own interest or the interest of another person or organization.\n\nA Trustee satisfies his or her duty of care by acting in good faith with the care of an ordinarily prudent person and in a manner the Trustee reasonably believes to be in the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.\n\nTrustees and Officers.\n\nThe Board of the Fund consists of ten Trustees.\n\nThese same individuals also serve as directors or trustees for certain of the funds advised by the Adviser and Morgan Stanley AIP GP LP.", "None of the Trustees have an affiliation or business connection with the Adviser or any of its affiliated persons or own any stock or other securities issued by the Adviser\u2019s parent company, Morgan Stanley.\n\nThese are the \u201cnon-interested\u201d or \u201cIndependent\u201d Trustees as defined under the 1940 Act.\n\nBoard Structure and Oversight Function.\n\nThe Board\u2019s leadership structure features an Independent Trustee serving as Chairperson and the Board Committees described below.\n\nThe Chairperson participates in the preparation of the agenda for meetings of the Board and the preparation of information to be presented to the Board with respect to matters to be acted upon by the Board.\n\nThe Chairperson also presides at all meetings of the Board and is involved in discussions regarding matters pertaining to the oversight of the management of the Fund between meetings.\n\nBack to Table of Contents", "The Board of Trustees operates using a system of committees to facilitate the timely and efficient consideration of all matters of importance to the Trustees, the Fund and Fund shareholders, and to facilitate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and oversight of the Fund\u2019s activities and associated risks.\n\nThe Board of Trustees has established six standing committees: (1) Audit Committee, (2) Governance Committee, (3) Compliance and Insurance Committee, (4) Equity Investment Committee, (5) Fixed Income, Liquidity and Alternatives Investment Committee and (6) Risk Committee, which are each comprised exclusively of Independent Trustees.\n\nEach committee charter governs the scope of the committee\u2019s responsibilities with respect to the oversight of the Fund.\n\nThe responsibilities of each committee, including their oversight responsibilities, are described further under the caption \u201cIndependent Trustees and the Committees.\u201d", "The Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational and valuation risk, among others.\n\nThe Board of Trustees oversees these risks as part of its broader oversight of the Fund\u2019s affairs through various Board and committee activities.\n\nThe Board has adopted, and periodically reviews, policies and procedures designed to address various risks to the Fund.\n\nIn addition, appropriate personnel, including but not limited to the Fund\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer, members of the Fund\u2019s administration and accounting teams, representatives from the Fund\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, the Fund\u2019s Treasurer, portfolio management personnel, risk management personnel and independent valuation and brokerage evaluation service providers, make regular reports regarding the Fund\u2019s activities and related risks to the Board of Trustees and the committees, as appropriate.", "These reports include, among others, quarterly performance reports, quarterly risk reports and discussions with members of the risk teams relating to each asset class.\n\nThe Board\u2019s committee structure allows separate committees to focus on different aspects of risk and the potential impact of these risks on some or all of the funds in the complex and then report back to the full Board.\n\nIn between regular meetings, Fund officers also communicate with the Trustees regarding material exceptions and items relevant to the Board\u2019s risk oversight function.\n\nThe Board recognizes that it is not possible to identify all of the risks that may affect the Fund, and that it is not possible to develop processes and controls to eliminate all of the risks that may affect the Fund.\n\nMoreover, the Board recognizes that it may be necessary for the Fund to bear certain risks (such as investment risk) to achieve its investment objective.", "As needed between meetings of the Board, the Board or a specific committee receives and reviews reports relating to the Fund and engages in discussions with appropriate parties relating to the Fund\u2019s operations and related risks.\n\nManagement Information\n\nTrustees.\n\nThe Fund seeks as Trustees individuals of distinction and experience in business and finance, government service or academia.\n\nIn determining that a particular Trustee was and continues to be qualified to serve as Trustee, the Board has considered a variety of criteria, none of which, in isolation, was controlling.\n\nBased on a review of the experience, qualifications, attributes or skills of each Trustee, including those enumerated in the table below, the Board has determined that each of the Trustees is qualified to serve as a Trustee of the Fund.", "In addition, the Board believes that, collectively, the Trustees have balanced and diverse experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that allow the Board to operate effectively in governing the Fund and protecting the interests of shareholders.\n\nInformation about the Fund\u2019s Governance Committee and Board of Trustees nomination process is provided below under the caption \u201cIndependent Trustees and the Committees.\u201d\n\nThe Trustees of the Fund, their birth years, addresses,

return equal to the total return on one or more of the Morgan Stanley Funds that are offered as investment options under the DC Plan.\n\nAt the Trustee\u2019s election, distributions are either in one lump sum payment, or in the form of equal annual installments over a period of five years.\n\nThe rights of an eligible Trustee and the beneficiaries to the amounts held under the DC Plan are unsecured and such amounts are subject to the claims of the creditors of the Fund.", "Prior to April 1, 2004, certain Morgan Stanley Funds maintained a similar Deferred Compensation Plan (the

year.\n\nGenerally, the DC Plan amends and supersedes the Prior DC Plan and all amounts payable under the Prior DC Plan are now subject to the terms of the DC Plan (except for amounts paid during the

continue the Plan, the Trustees considered: (1) the Fund\u2019s experience under the Plan and whether such experience indicates that the Plan is operating as anticipated; (2) the benefits the Fund had obtained, was obtaining and would be likely to obtain under the Plan, including that: (a) the Plan is essential in order to give Fund investors a choice of alternatives for payment of distribution and service charges and to enable the Fund to continue to grow and avoid a pattern of net redemptions which, in turn, are essential for effective investment management; and (b) without the compensation to individual brokers and the reimbursement of distribution and account maintenance expenses of Financial Intermediaries made possible by the 12b-1 fees, Financial Intermediaries could not establish and maintain an effective system for distribution, servicing of Fund shareholders and maintenance of shareholder accounts; and (3) what services had been provided and were continuing to be provided under the Plan to the Fund and its shareholders.", "Based upon their review, the Trustees, including each of the Independent Trustees, determined that continuation of the Plan would be in the best interest

portfolio managers may manage assets for other investment companies, pooled investment vehicles and/or other accounts (including institutional clients, pension plans and certain high net worth individuals), there may be an incentive to favor one client over another resulting in conflicts of interest.\n\nFor instance, the Adviser may receive fees from certain accounts that are higher than the fee it receives from the Fund, or it may receive a performance-based fee on certain accounts.\n\nIn those instances, the portfolio managers may have an incentive to favor the higher and/or performance-based fee accounts over the Fund.", "In addition, a conflict of interest could exist to the extent the Adviser has proprietary investments in certain accounts, where portfolio managers have personal investments in certain accounts or when certain accounts are investment options in the Adviser\u2019s employee benefits and/or deferred compensation plans.\n\nThe portfolio managers may have an incentive to favor these accounts over others.\n\nIf the Adviser manages accounts that engage in short sales of securities of the type in which the Fund invests, the Adviser could be seen as harming the performance of the Fund for the benefit of the accounts engaging in short sales if the short sales cause the market value of the securities to fall.\n\nThe Adviser has adopted trade

standards, or causes a loss of revenue associated with a position on which the employee was paid and the employee operated outside of internal control policies.\n\nEligibility for, and the amount of any, discretionary compensation is subject to a multi-dimensional process.\n\nSpecifically, consideration is given to one or more of the following factors, which can vary by portfolio management team

broker-dealers periodically to determine whether broker-dealers on the approved list continue to meet such criteria.\n\nThe approval lists are reported quarterly to the Adviser\u2019s Counterparty Governance Committee.", "When selecting an approved broker-dealer (including an affiliate) to execute securities transactions, the following factors may be considered: (i) best available price; (ii) reliability, integrity and reputation in the industry (which may include a review of financial information and creditworthiness); (iii) execution capabilities, including block positioning, speed of execution and quality and responsiveness of its trading desk; (iv) knowledge of and access to the markets for the securities being traded; (v) potential ability to obtain price improvement; (vi) ability to maintain confidentiality; (vii) ability to handle non-traditional trades; (viii) commission and commission-equivalent rates; (ix) technology infrastructure; (x) clearance and settlement capabilities; (xi) the size of the trade relative to other trades in the same instrument; (xii) ability of a counterparty to commit its capital to the Fund\u2019s trade and its access to liquidity; (xiii) counterparty restrictions associated with a portfolio, including regulatory trading, documentation requirement or any specific clearing broker-dealer requirements; (xiv) client-directed execution; (xv) client-specific restrictions; and (xvi) such other factors as may be appropriate.", "Subject to the duty to seek best execution, the Adviser uses a portion of the commissions generated when executing client transactions to acquire brokerage and research services that aid in fulfilling investment decision-making responsibilities in accordance with Section 28(e) and applicable law.\n\nCommissions paid to broker-dealers providing brokerage and research services may be higher than those charged by other broker-dealers.\n\nSubject to applicable law, the Adviser receives a benefit when using client commissions to obtain brokerage and research services because the Adviser does not have to produce or pay for the brokerage research services itself.\n\nTherefore, the Adviser has an incentive to select or recommend a broker-dealer based on its interest in receiving brokerage and research services, rather than solely on its clients\u2019 interest in obtaining the best price.\n\nBack to Table of Contents", "The Adviser has adopted policies and procedures designed to help track and evaluate the benefits received from brokerage and research services, as well as to track how much clients pay above the amount that broker-dealers from which the Adviser receives brokerage and research services may have charged solely for execution of such trades.\n\nThe Adviser utilizes a voting system to assist in making a good faith determination of the value of brokerage and research services it receives in accordance with Section 28(e) and applicable law.\n\nIn many cases, these involve subjective judgments or approximations.\n\nThe Adviser has established a process for budgeting research costs and allocating such costs across client accounts.\n\nThe Adviser and certain other affiliated advisers have entered into commission sharing arrangements (\u201cCSAs\u201d) with executing brokers (\u201cCSA Partners\u201d) and a third-party vendor (\u201cCSA Aggregator\u201d).", "Pursuant to these arrangements, and under the Adviser\u2019s supervision, the CSA Partners and CSA Aggregator track execution and research commissions separately and pool and distribute research credits in accordance with the policies and procedures discussed above to approved research providers (which may include executing brokerage firms or independent research providers (\u201cApproved Research Providers\u201d)) that provide brokerage and research services.\n\nThe CSA Aggregator also reconciles research credits from trades with CSA Partners, and pays Approved Research Providers and provides other related administrative functions.\n\nIn addition, a CSA Partner may provide the Adviser with proprietary research it has developed and, upon instruction, may retain research commission credits as compensation for the provision of such proprietary research services.", "The Adviser believes that these arrangements allow it to monitor the amount of trading costs that are attributable to execution services on the one hand and other brokerage and research services on the other.\n\nTransactions that generate research credits include equity transactions executed on an agency basis or via a riskless principal transaction where the executing broker-dealer receives a commission.\n\nThe Adviser does not use CSAs or otherwise have arrangements to pay for brokerage and research services with client commissions in connection with trading fixed income securities.\n\nConsistent with long-standing industry practice in the fixed income markets, however, the Adviser, subject to applicable law, may receive brokerage and research services and other information, including access to fixed income trading platforms that dealers provide for no charge to their customers in the ordinary course of business.", "Fixed income instruments typically trade at a bid/ask spread and without an explicit brokerage charge.\n\nWhile there is not a formal trading expense or commission, clients will bear the implicit trading costs reflected in these spreads.\n\nThe Adviser may receive \u201cmixed use\u201d products and services from an Approved Research Provider, where a portion of the product or service assists in its investment decision-making process in accordance with Section 28(e) and a portion may be used for other purposes.\n\nWhere a product or service has a mixed use, the Adviser will make a reasonable allocation of its cost according to its use and will use client commissions to pay only for the portion of the product or service that assists in its investment decision-making process.\n\nThe Adviser may have an incentive to allocate the costs to uses that assist in its investment decision-making process because the Adviser may pay for such costs with client commissions rather than its own resources.", "To the extent the Adviser receives \u201cmixed use\u201d products and services, the Adviser will allocate the anticipated costs of a mixed use product or service in good faith and maintain records concerning allocations in order to mitigate such conflicts.\n\nClient accounts that pay a greater amount of commissions relative to other accounts may bear a greater share of the cost of brokerage and research services than such other accounts.\n\nThe Adviser may use brokerage and research services obtained with brokerage commissions from some clients for the benefit of other clients whose brokerage commissions do not pay for such brokerage and research services.\n\nThe Adviser may also share brokerage and research services with its affiliated advisers, and the clients of its affiliated advisers may receive the benefits of such brokerage and research services.\n\nThese arrangements remain subject to the Adviser\u2019s overall obligation to seek best execution for client trading.", "The EU\u2019s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (\u201cMiFID II\u201d), which became effective January 3, 2018, requires investment advisers regulated under MiFID II to pay for research services separately from trade execution services, either through their own resources or a research payment account funded by a specific charge to a client.\n\nAlthough the Adviser is not directly subject to the provisions of MiFID II, certain of its affiliated advisers are, such as Morgan Stanley Investment Management Limited; accordingly, as applicable, the Adviser makes a reasonable valuation and allocation of the cost of research services as between MiFID II client accounts and other accounts that participate in CSAs and will pay for research services received with respect to MiFID II client accounts from its own resources.\n\nThe Adviser and affiliated advisers subject to MiFID II may separately pay for fixed income research from their own resources.", "Following its withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom has entered a transition period, during which EU law (including MiFID II) will continue to apply in the United Kingdom.\n\nFollowing the transition period, investment managers in the United Kingdom may still be required to comply with certain MiFID II equivalent requirements in accordance with the handbook of rules and guidance issued by the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nWhen permitted under applicable law, portfolio managers generally will aggregate orders of their clients for the same securities in a single order so that such orders are executed simultaneously in order to facilitate best execution and to reduce brokerage costs.\n\nThe Adviser effects aggregated orders in a manner designed to ensure that no participating client is favored over any other client.\n\nIn general, accounts that participate in an aggregated order will participate on a pro rata or other objective basis.", "Pro rata allocation of securities and other instruments will generally consist of allocation based on the order size of a participating client account in\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nproportion to the size of the orders placed for other accounts participating in the aggregated order.\n\nHowever, the Adviser may allocate such securities and other instruments using a method other than pro rata if their supply is limited, based on differing portfolio characteristics among accounts or to avoid odd lots or small allocations, among other reasons.\n\nThese allocations are made in the good faith judgment of the Adviser with a goal of seeking to ensure that fair and equitable allocation occurs over time.\n\nThere may be times that the Adviser is not able to aggregate orders because of applicable law or other considerations when doing so might otherwise be advantageous.\n\nRegular Broker-Dealers", "During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 the Fund did not purchase securities issued by issuers who were among the ten brokers or ten dealers that executed transactions for or with the Fund in the largest dollar amounts during the period.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the Fund did not own any securities issued by any of such issuers.\n\nPortfolio Turnover\n\nThe Fund generally does not invest for short-term trading purposes; however, when circumstances warrant, the Fund may sell investment securities without regard to the length of time they have been held.\n\nMarket conditions in a given year could result in a higher or lower portfolio turnover rate than expected and the Fund will not consider portfolio turnover rate a limiting factor in making investment decisions consistent with its investment objectives and policies.\n\nHigher portfolio turnover (e.g., over 100%) necessarily will cause the Fund to pay correspondingly increased brokerage and trading costs.", "In addition to transaction costs, higher portfolio turnover may result in the realization of capital gains.\n\nAs discussed under \u201cTaxes,\u201d to the extent net short-term capital gains are realized, any distributions resulting from such gains are considered ordinary income for federal income tax purposes.\n\nCAPITAL STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES\n\nThe shareholders of the Fund are entitled to a full vote for each full share of beneficial interest held.\n\nThe Fund is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares of beneficial interest.\n\nAll shares of beneficial interest of the Fund are of $0.01 par value and are equal as to earnings, assets and voting privileges except that each class will have exclusive voting privileges with respect to matters relating to distribution expenses borne solely by such class or any other matter in which the interests of one class differ from the interests of any other class.", "Also, Class A, Class L and Class C shares bear expenses related to the distribution of their respective shares.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to authorize the creation of additional series of shares (the proceeds of which would be invested in separate, independently managed portfolios) and additional classes of shares within any series.\n\nThe Trustees have not presently authorized any such additional series or classes of shares other than as set forth in the Prospectus.\n\nThe Fund is not required to hold annual meetings of shareholders and in ordinary circumstances the Fund does not intend to hold such meetings.\n\nThe Trustees may call special meetings of shareholders for action by shareholder vote as may be required by the 1940 Act or the Declaration of Trust.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, the Trustees may be removed by the actions of the Trustees.", "In addition, under certain circumstances, the shareholders may call a meeting to remove the Trustees and the Fund is required to provide assistance in communicating with shareholders about such a meeting.\n\nThe voting rights of shareholders are not cumulative, so that holders of more than 50% of the shares voting can, if they choose, elect all Trustees being selected, while the holders of the remaining shares would be unable to elect any Trustees.\n\nUnder Massachusetts law, shareholders of a business trust may, under certain limited circumstances, be held personally liable as partners for the obligations of the Fund.\n\nHowever, the Declaration of Trust contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for acts or obligations of the Fund, requires that notice of such Fund obligations include such disclaimer, and provides for indemnification out of the Fund\u2019s property for any shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the Fund.", "Thus, the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which the Fund itself would be unable to meet its obligations.\n\nGiven the above limitations on shareholder personal liability, and the nature of the Trust\u2019s assets and operations, the possibility of the Fund being unable to meet its obligations is remote and thus, in the opinion of Massachusetts counsel to the Fund, the risk to Fund shareholders of personal liability is remote.\n\nThe Trustees themselves have the power to alter the number and the terms of office of the Trustees (as provided for in the Declaration of Trust), and they may at any time lengthen or shorten their own terms or make their terms of unlimited duration and appoint their own successors, provided that always at least a majority of the Trustees has been elected by the shareholders of the Fund.\n\nPURCHASE, REDEMPTION AND PRICING OF SHARES", "The Fund has suspended offering Class L shares of the Fund for sale to all investors.\n\nThe Class L shareholders of the Fund do not have the option of purchasing additional Class L shares, respectively.\n\nHowever, the existing Class L shareholders may invest in additional shares of their respective class through reinvestment of dividends and distributions.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nPurchase/Redemption of Shares\n\nInformation concerning how Fund shares are offered to the public (and how they are redeemed and exchanged) is provided in the Fund\u2019s Prospectus.\n\nSuspension of Redemptions.\n\nRedemptions are not made on days during which the NYSE is closed.", "The right of redemption may be suspended and the payment therefore may be postponed for more than seven days during any period when (a) the NYSE is closed for other than customary weekends or holidays; (b) the SEC determines trading on the NYSE is restricted; (c) the SEC determines an emergency exists as a result of which disposal by the Fund of securities owned by it is not reasonably practicable or it is not reasonably practicable for the Fund to fairly determine the value of its net assets; or (d) the SEC, by order, so permits.\n\nTransfer Agent as Agent.\n\nWith respect to the redemption or repurchase of Fund shares, the application of proceeds to the purchase of new shares in the Fund or any other Morgan Stanley Funds and the general administration of the exchange privilege, the Transfer Agent acts as agent for the Distributor and for the shareholder\u2019s authorized broker-dealer, if any, in the performance of such functions.", "With respect to exchanges, redemptions or repurchases, the Transfer Agent is liable for its own negligence and not for the default or negligence of its correspondents or for losses in transit.\n\nThe Fund is not liable for any default or negligence of the Transfer Agent, the Distributor or any authorized broker-dealer.\n\nThe Distributor and any authorized broker-dealer have appointed the Transfer Agent to act as their agent in connection with the application of proceeds of any redemption of Fund shares to the purchase of shares of any other Morgan Stanley Fund and the general administration of the exchange privilege.\n\nNo commission or discounts will be paid to the Distributor or any authorized broker-dealer for any transaction pursuant to the exchange privilege.\n\nTransfers of Shares.\n\nIn the event a shareholder requests a transfer of Fund shares to a new registration, the shares will be transferred without sales charge at the time of transfer.", "With regard to the status of shares which are either subject to the CDSC or free of such charge (and with regard to the length of time shares subject to the charge have been held), any transfer involving less than all of the shares in an account will be made on a pro rata basis (that is, by transferring shares in the same proportion that the transferred shares bear to the total shares in the account immediately prior to the transfer).\n\nThe transferred shares will continue to be subject to any applicable CDSC as if they had not been so transferred.\n\nOutside Brokerage Accounts/Limited Portability.\n\nMost Fund shareholders hold their shares with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC.\n\nPlease note that your ability to transfer your Fund shares to a brokerage account at another securities dealer may be limited.\n\nFund shares may only be transferred to accounts held at securities dealers or Financial Intermediaries.\n\nAfter a transfer, you may purchase additional shares of the Morgan Stanley Fund(s)", "you owned before the transfer and, in most instances, you will also be able to purchase shares of most other Morgan Stanley Funds.\n\nIf you transfer shares of a fund that is not a Morgan Stanley Multi-Class Fund (for example, a Morgan Stanley Money Market Fund) you will not be able to exchange shares of that fund for any other Morgan Stanley Fund after the transfer.\n\nIf you wish to transfer Fund shares to a securities dealer or other financial intermediary that has not entered into an agreement with the Distributor, you may request that the securities dealer or financial intermediary maintain the shares in an account at the Transfer Agent registered in the name of such securities dealer or financial intermediary for your benefit.\n\nYou may also hold your Fund shares in your own name directly with the Transfer Agent.\n\nIn either case, you will continue to have the ability to purchase additional Morgan Stanley Funds and will have full exchange privileges.", "Other options may also be available; please check with the respective securities dealer or financial intermediary.\n\nIf you choose not to hold your shares with the Transfer Agent, either directly or through a securities dealer or other financial intermediary, you must redeem your shares and pay any applicable CDSC.\n\nOffering Price\n\nThe Fund\u2019s Class I, Class C, Class R6 and Class IR shares are offered at NAV and the Class A shares are offered at NAV plus any applicable FSC which is distributed among the Fund\u2019s Distributor, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC and other Financial Intermediaries as described in \u201cInvestment Advisory and Other Services \u2014 Rule 12b-1 Plan.\u201d\n\nThe NAV of the Fund (excluding sales charges) is based on the value of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities.", "NAV of each Class is calculated by dividing the value of the portion of the Fund\u2019s securities and other assets attributable to that Class, less the total market value of the liabilities attributable to that Class, by the number of shares of that Class outstanding.\n\nThe assets of each Class of shares are invested in a single portfolio.\n\nThe NAV of each Class, however, will differ because the Classes have different ongoing fees.", "In the calculation of the Fund\u2019s NAV: (1) an equity portfolio security listed or traded on an exchange is valued at its latest reported sale price (or at the exchange official closing price if such exchange reports an official closing price), and if there were no sales on a given day and if there is no official exchange closing price for that day, the security is valued at the mean between the last reported bid and asked prices if such bid and asked prices are available on the relevant exchanges; and (2) all other equity portfolio securities for which OTC market quotations are readily available are valued at the latest reported sale price (or at the market official closing price if such market reports an official closing price), and if there was no trading in the security on a given day and if there is no official closing price from the relevant markets for that day, the security is valued at the mean between the last reported bid and asked\n\nBack to Table of Contents", "prices if such bid and asked prices are available on the relevant markets.\n\nListed equity securities not traded on the valuation date with no reported bid and asked prices available on the exchange are valued at the mean between the current bid and asked prices obtained from one or more reputable brokers or dealers.\n\nAn unlisted equity security that does not trade on the valuation date and for which bid and asked prices from the relevant markets are unavailable is valued at the mean between the current bid and asked prices obtained from one or more reputable brokers or dealers.\n\nIn cases where a security is traded on more than one exchange, the security is valued on the exchange designated as the primary market.", "When no market quotations are readily available for a security or other asset, including circumstances under which the Adviser determines that a market quotation is not accurate, fair value for the security or other asset will be determined in good faith using methods approved by the Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees.\n\nFor valuation purposes, quotations of foreign portfolio securities, other assets and liabilities and forward contracts stated in foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollar equivalents at the prevailing market rates prior to the close of the NYSE.", "If the NYSE is closed due to inclement weather, technology problems or any other reason on a day it would normally be open for business, or the NYSE has an unscheduled early closing on a day it has opened for business, the Fund reserves the right to treat such day as a business day and accept purchase and redemption orders until, and calculate its NAV as of, the normally scheduled close of regular trading on the NYSE for that day, so long as the Adviser believes there generally remains an adequate market to obtain reliable and accurate market quotations.\n\nCertain of the Fund\u2019s portfolio securities may be valued using as an input evaluated prices provided by an approved outside pricing service.\n\nPrices obtained from these approved sources are monitored and reviewed by the Adviser\u2019s Valuation Committee and if not deemed to represent fair value, may be overridden and valued using procedures approved by the Board.", "The pricing service may utilize a matrix system or other model incorporating attributes such as security quality, maturity and coupon as the evaluation model parameters, and/or research evaluations by its staff, including review of broker-dealer market price quotations in determining what it believes is the fair valuation of the portfolio securities valued by such pricing service.\n\nListed options are valued at the last reported sales price on the exchange on which they are listed (or at the exchange official closing price if such exchange reports an official closing price).\n\nIf an official closing price or last reported sale price is unavailable, the listed option should be fair valued at the mean between its latest bid and ask prices.\n\nIf an exchange closing price or bid and asked prices are not available from the exchange, then the quotes from one or more brokers or dealers may be used.", "Unlisted options and swaps are valued by an approved outside pricing service or quotes from a broker or dealer.\n\nUnlisted options and swaps cleared on a clearinghouse or exchange may be valued using the closing price provided by the clearinghouse or exchange.\n\nFutures are valued at the settlement price on the exchange on which they trade or, if a settlement price is unavailable, then at the last sale price on the exchange.\n\nIf the Adviser determines that the valuation received from the outside pricing service or broker or dealer is not reflective of the security\u2019s market value, such security is valued at its fair value as determined in good faith using methods approved by the Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees.\n\nGenerally, trading in foreign securities, as well as corporate bonds, U.S. government securities and money market instruments, is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of the NYSE.", "The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are determined as of such times.\n\nForeign currency exchange rates are also generally determined prior to the close of the NYSE.\n\nOccasionally, events which may affect the values of such securities and such exchange rates may occur between the times at which they are determined and the close of the NYSE.\n\nIf events that may affect the value of such securities occur during such period, then these securities may be valued at their fair value as determined in good faith using methods approved by the Fund\u2019s Board of Trustees.\n\nIn general, fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nWhen there is no public market or possibly no market at all for an asset, fair value represents, in general, a good faith approximation of the current value of an asset.", "A security that is fair valued may be valued at a price higher or lower than actual market quotations or the value determined by other funds using their own fair valuation procedures or by other investors.\n\nThe fair value of an asset may not be the price at which that asset is ultimately sold.\n\nThe Fund relies on various sources to calculate its NAV.\n\nThe ability of the Fund to calculate the NAV per share of the Fund is subject to operational risks associated with processing or human errors, systems or technology failures, cyber attacks and errors caused by third party service providers, data sources, or trading counterparties.\n\nSuch failures may result in delays in the calculation of the Fund\u2019s NAV and/or the inability to calculate NAV over extended time periods.\n\nThe Fund may be unable to recover any losses associated with such failures.", "In addition, if the third-party service providers and/or data sources upon which the Fund directly or indirectly relies to calculate its NAV or price individual securities are unavailable or otherwise unable to calculate the NAV correctly, it may be necessary for alternative procedures to be utilized to price the securities at the time of determining the Fund\u2019s NAV.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nTAXES\n\nThe Fund generally will make two basic types of distributions: ordinary dividends and long-term capital gain distributions.\n\nThese two types of distributions are reported differently on a shareholder\u2019s income tax return.\n\nThe tax treatment of the investment activities of the Fund will affect the amount, timing and character of the distributions made by the Fund.\n\nThe following discussion is only a summary of certain tax considerations generally affecting the Fund and shareholders of the Fund and is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning.", "Tax issues relating to the Fund are not generally a consideration for shareholders such as tax-exempt entities and tax-advantaged retirement vehicles such as an IRA or 401(k) plan.\n\nShareholders are urged to consult their own tax professionals regarding specific questions as to federal, state or local taxes.\n\nInvestment Company Taxation.\n\nThe Fund intends to continue to qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code.\n\nAs such, the Fund will not be subject to federal income tax on its net investment income and capital gains, if any, to the extent that it timely distributes such income and capital gains to its shareholders.\n\nIf the Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC, all of its taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the Fund\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits.", "The Fund generally intends to distribute sufficient income and gains so that the Fund will not pay corporate income tax on its earnings.\n\nThe Fund also generally intends to distribute to its shareholders in each calendar year a sufficient amount of ordinary income and capital gains to avoid the imposition of a 4% excise tax.\n\nHowever, the Fund may instead determine to retain all or part of any income or net long-term capital gains in any year for reinvestment.\n\nIn such event, the Fund will pay federal income tax (and possibly excise tax) on such retained income or gains.\n\nGains or losses on sales of securities by the Fund will generally be long-term capital gains or losses if the securities have a tax holding period of more than one year at the time of such sale.\n\nGains or losses on the sale of securities with a tax holding period of one year or less will be short-term capital gains or losses.", "Special tax rules may change the normal treatment of gains and losses recognized by the Fund when the Fund invests in forward foreign currency exchange contracts, options, futures transactions and non-U.S. corporations classified as \u201cpassive foreign investment companies.\u201d\n\nThose special tax rules can, among other things, affect the treatment of capital gain or loss as long-term or short-term and may result in ordinary income or loss rather than capital gain or loss.\n\nThe application of these special rules would therefore also affect the character of distributions made by the Fund.\n\nThe Fund may invest in stocks of foreign companies that may be classified under the Code as passive foreign investment companies (\u201cPFICs\u201d).\n\nIn general, a foreign company is classified as a PFIC if at least one-half of its assets constitute investment-type assets or 75% or more of its gross income is investment-type income.", "When investing in PFIC securities, the Fund intends to mark-to-market these securities under certain provisions of the Code and recognize any unrealized gains as ordinary income at the end of the Fund\u2019s fiscal and excise tax years.\n\nDeductions for losses are allowable only to the extent of any current or previously recognized gains.\n\nThese gains (reduced by allowable losses) are treated as ordinary income that the Fund is required to distribute, even though it has not sold or received dividends from these securities.\n\nIn addition, if the Fund is unable to identify an investment as a PFIC and thus does not make a mark-to-market election, the Fund may be subject to U.S. federal income tax and interest on a portion of any \u201cexcess distribution\u201d or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed as a taxable dividend by the Fund to its shareholders.", "The Fund may be subject to foreign withholding taxes with respect to its dividend and interest income from foreign countries, and the Fund may be subject to foreign income taxes with respect to other income.\n\nIf more than 50% in value of the Fund\u2019s total assets at the close of the taxable year consists of stock or securities of foreign corporations, the Fund may elect to treat certain foreign income taxes imposed on it for federal income tax purposes as paid directly by its shareholders.\n\nBecause it is not anticipated that securities of foreign issuers will constitute more than 50% of the Fund\u2019s total assets at the end of any taxable year, shareholders should not expect to be eligible to claim a foreign tax credit or deduction on their federal income tax returns with respect to foreign taxes imposed on the Fund.\n\nThe Fund may seek to gain exposure to bitcoin through investments in the Subsidiary.", "Historically, the IRS has issued private letter rulings in which the IRS specifically concluded that income and gains from investments in a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary that invests in commodity-linked instruments are \u201cqualifying income\u201d for purposes of the qualifying income test described above.\n\nThe Fund has not received such a private letter ruling, and is not able to rely on private letter rulings issued to other taxpayers.\n\nApplicable Treasury regulations would generally treat the Fund\u2019s income inclusion with respect to the Subsidiary as qualifying income either if (i) there is a current year distribution out of the earnings and profits of the Subsidiary that are attributable to such income inclusion or (ii) such inclusion is derived with respect to the Fund\u2019s business of investing in stock, securities or currencies.", "The tax treatment of the Fund\u2019s investments in the Subsidiary may be adversely affected by future legislation, court decisions, Treasury Regulations and/or guidance issued by the IRS that could affect whether income derived from such investments is \u201cqualifying income\u201d under Subchapter M of the Code, or otherwise affect the character, timing and/or amount of the Fund\u2019s taxable income or any gains and distributions made by the Fund.\n\nNo assurances can be provided that the IRS would not be able to successfully assert that the Fund\u2019s income from such investments was not \u201cqualifying income,\u201d in which case the Fund would fail to qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M of the\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nCode if over 10% of its gross income was derived from these investments.", "If the Fund failed to qualify as a RIC, it would be subject to federal and state income tax on all of its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates with no deduction for any distributions paid to shareholders, which would significantly adversely affect the returns to, and could cause substantial losses for, Fund shareholders.\n\nA foreign corporation, such as the Subsidiary, will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless it is deemed to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business.\n\nThe rules regarding whether the Subsidiary will be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business as a result of its bitcoin related investments are not certain.\n\nIt is expected that the Subsidiary will conduct its activities in a manner so as to meet the requirements of a safe harbor under Section 864(b)(2) of the Code under which the Subsidiary may engage in trading in stocks or securities or certain commodities without being deemed to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business.", "However, if certain of the Subsidiary\u2019s activities were determined not to be of the type described in the safe harbor, then the activities of the Subsidiary may constitute a U.S. trade or business, or be taxed as such.\n\nIn general, a foreign corporation, such as the Subsidiary, that does not conduct a U.S. trade or business is nonetheless subject to tax at a flat rate of 30 percent (or lower tax treaty rate), generally payable through withholding, on the gross amount of certain U.S.-source income that is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.\n\nThere is presently no tax treaty in force between the U.S. and the Cayman Islands that would reduce this rate of withholding tax.\n\nIt is not expected that the Subsidiary will derive income subject to such withholding tax.\n\nThe Subsidiary will be treated as a controlled foreign corporation and the Fund will be treated as a \u201cU.S. shareholder\u201d of the Subsidiary.", "As a result, the Fund will be required to include in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes all of the Subsidiary\u2019s \u201cSubpart F income,\u201d whether or not such income is distributed by the Subsidiary.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s recognition of the Subsidiary\u2019s \u201cSubpart F income\u201d will increase the Fund\u2019s tax basis in its respective Subsidiary.\n\nDistributions by the Subsidiary to the Fund will be tax-free, to the extent of their previously undistributed \u201cSubpart F income,\u201d and will correspondingly reduce the Fund\u2019s tax basis in the Subsidiary.\n\n\u201cSubpart F income\u201d is generally treated as ordinary income, regardless of the character of the Subsidiary\u2019s underlying income.\n\nIf a net loss is realized by the Subsidiary, such loss is not generally available to offset the income earned by the Fund, and such loss cannot be carried forward to offset taxable income of the Fund or the Subsidiary in future periods.", "The Fund may make investments in which it recognizes income or gain prior to receiving cash with respect to such investment.\n\nFor example, under certain tax rules, the Fund may be required to accrue a portion of any discount at which certain securities are purchased as income each year even though the Fund receives no payments in cash on the security during the year.\n\nTo the extent that the Fund makes such investments, it generally would be required to pay out such income or gain as a distribution in each year to avoid taxation at the Fund level.\n\nSuch distributions will be made from the available cash of the Fund or by liquidation of portfolio securities if necessary.\n\nIf a distribution of cash necessitates the liquidation of portfolio securities, the Adviser will select which securities to sell.\n\nThe Fund may realize a gain or loss from such sales.", "In the event the Fund realizes net capital gains from such transactions, its shareholders may receive a larger capital gain distribution, if any, than they would in the absence of such transactions.\n\nDistributions from capital gains generally are made after applying any available capital loss carryforwards.\n\nCapital loss carryforwards are reduced to the extent they offset current-year net realized capital gains, whether the Fund retains or distributes such gains.\n\nIf the Fund incurs or has incurred capital losses in excess of capital gains (\u201cnet capital losses\u201d), those losses will be carried forward to one or more subsequent taxable years; any such carryforward losses will retain their character as short-term or long-term.\n\nIn the event that a Fund were to experience an ownership change as defined under the Code, the capital loss carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of the Fund, if any, may be subject to limitation.\n\nRisk of Failure to Qualify as a RIC.", "To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally accorded to RICs, the Fund must, among other things, derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from certain prescribed sources, meet certain asset diversification tests and distribute for each taxable year at least 90% of its \u201cinvestment company taxable income\u201d (generally, ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of net short-term capital gain over net long-term capital loss).\n\nIf for any taxable year the Fund does not qualify as a RIC, all of its taxable income for that year (including its net capital gain) would be subject to tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and such distributions would be taxable as ordinary dividends to the extent of the Fund\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits.\n\nTaxation of Dividends and Distributions.", "Shareholders normally will be subject to regular federal income taxes, and any state and/or local income taxes, on the dividends and other distributions they receive from the Fund.\n\nSuch dividends and distributions, to the extent that they are derived from net investment income or short-term capital gains, are generally taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income regardless of whether the shareholder receives such payments in additional shares or in cash.\n\nIf certain holding period requirements are met with respect to a shareholder\u2019s shares, a portion (which, if any, is not expected to be significant) of the income dividends received by a shareholder may be taxed at the same rate as long-term capital gains.\n\nHowever, even if income received in the form of income dividends is taxed at the same rates as long-term capital gains, such income will not be considered long-term capital gains for other federal income tax purposes.", "For example, you generally will not be permitted to offset income dividends with capital losses.\n\nShort-term capital gain distributions will continue to be taxed at ordinary income rates.\n\nDistributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to shareholders as long-term capital gains regardless of how long a shareholder has held the Fund\u2019s shares and regardless of whether the distribution is received in additional shares or in cash.\n\nThe\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nmaximum individual rate applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d and long-term capital gains is generally either 15% or 20%, depending on whether the individual\u2019s income exceeds certain threshold amounts.\n\nShareholders are generally taxed on any income dividend or capital gain distributions from the Fund in the year they are actually distributed.", "However, if any such dividends or distributions are declared in October, November or December and paid to shareholders of record of such month in January then such amounts will be treated for tax purposes as received by the shareholders on December 31.\n\nSubject to certain exceptions, a corporate shareholder may be eligible for a dividends received deduction to the extent that the Fund earns and distributes qualifying dividends from its investments.\n\nDistributions of net capital gains by the Fund will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction.\n\nIndividuals and certain other noncorporate entities are generally eligible for a 20% deduction with respect to ordinary dividends received from REITs (\u201cqualified REIT dividends\u201d) and certain taxable income from master limited partnerships (\u201cMLPs\u201d) through 2025.\n\nApplicable Treasury regulations permit a regulated investment company to pass through to its shareholders qualified REIT dividends eligible for the 20% deduction.", "However, the regulations do not provide a mechanism for a regulated investment company to pass through to its shareholders income from MLPs that would be eligible for such deduction if received directly by the shareholders.\n\nAn additional 3.8% Medicare tax is imposed on certain net investment income (including ordinary dividends and capital gain distributions received from the Fund and net gains from redemptions or other taxable dispositions of Fund shares) of U.S. individuals, estates and trusts to the extent that such person\u2019s \u201cmodified adjusted gross income\u201d (in the case of an individual) or \u201cadjusted gross income\u201d (in the case of an estate or trust) exceeds certain threshold amounts.\n\nShareholders who are not citizens or residents of the United States and certain foreign entities will generally be subject to withholding of U.S. tax at a rate of 30% on distributions made by the Fund of investment income and short-term capital gains.", "Dividends reported by the Fund as \u201cinterest-related dividends\u201d or \u201cshort-term capital gain dividends,\u201d will generally not be subject to U.S. withholding tax, provided that the income would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if earned directly by the foreign shareholder.\n\nHowever, depending on the circumstances, the Fund may designate all, some or none of the Fund\u2019s potentially eligible dividends as exempt.\n\nProspective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the specific tax consequences discussed above.\n\nSuch prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of dividends and distributions and the potential applicability of the U.S. estate tax.", "The Fund is required to withhold U.S. tax (at a 30% rate) on payments of taxable dividends made to certain non-U.S. entities that fail to comply (or be deemed compliant) with extensive new reporting and withholding requirements designed to inform the U.S. Department of the Treasury of U.S.-owned foreign investment accounts.\n\nShareholders may be requested to provide additional information to the Fund to enable the Fund to determine whether withholding is required.\n\nAfter the end of each calendar year, shareholders will be sent information on their dividends and capital gain distributions for tax purposes, including the portion taxable as ordinary income, the portion taxable as long-term capital gains and the amount of any dividends eligible for the federal dividends received deduction for corporations.\n\nPurchases and Redemptions and Exchanges of Fund Shares.", "Any dividend or capital gains distribution received by a shareholder from any investment company will have the effect of reducing the NAV of the shareholder\u2019s stock in that company by the exact amount of the dividend or capital gains distribution.\n\nFurthermore, such dividends and capital gains distributions are subject to regular federal income taxes.\n\nIf the NAV of the shares should be reduced below a shareholder\u2019s cost as a result of the payment of dividends or the distribution of realized long-term capital gains, such payment or distribution would be in part a return of the shareholder\u2019s investment but nonetheless would be taxable to the shareholder.\n\nTherefore, an investor should consider the tax implications of purchasing Fund shares immediately prior to a distribution record date.\n\nShareholders normally will be subject to regular federal income taxes, and state and/or local income taxes, on the sale or disposition of Fund shares.", "In general, a sale of shares results in capital gain or loss, and for individual shareholders, is taxable at a federal rate dependent upon the length of time the shares were held.\n\nA redemption of a shareholder\u2019s Fund shares is normally treated as a sale for tax purposes.\n\nFund shares held for a period of one year or less at the time of such sale or redemption will, for tax purposes, generally result in short-term capital gains or losses and those held for more than one year will generally result in long-term capital gains or losses.\n\nThe maximum individual rate applicable to long-term capital gains is generally either 15% or 20%, depending on whether the individual\u2019s income exceeds certain threshold amounts.\n\nAny loss realized by shareholders upon a sale or redemption of shares within six months of the date of their purchase will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any distributions of net long-term capital gains with respect to such shares during the six-month period.", "Gain or loss on the sale or redemption of shares in the Fund is measured by the difference between the amount of cash received (or the fair market value of any property received) and the adjusted tax basis of the shares.\n\nShareholders should keep records of\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\ninvestments made (including shares acquired through reinvestment of dividends and distributions) so they can compute the tax basis of their shares.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, a shareholder may compute and use an average cost basis in determining the gain or loss on the sale or redemption of shares.\n\nThe Fund (or its administrative agent) is required to report to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and furnish to Fund shareholders the cost basis information for sale transactions of shares purchased on or after January 1, 2012.", "Shareholders may elect to have one of several cost basis methods applied to their account when calculating the cost basis of shares sold, including average cost, FIFO (\u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d), or some other specific identification method.\n\nUnless you instruct otherwise, the Fund will use average cost as its default cost basis method, and will treat sales as first coming from shares purchased prior to January 1, 2012.\n\nIf average cost is used for the first sale of Fund shares covered by these rules, the shareholder may only use an alternative cost basis method for shares purchased prospectively.\n\nFund shareholders should consult with their tax advisors to determine the best cost basis method for their tax situation.\n\nExchanges of Fund shares for shares of another fund, including shares of other Morgan Stanley Funds, are also subject to similar tax treatment.", "Such an exchange is treated for tax purposes as a sale of the original shares in the Fund, followed by the purchase of shares in the other fund.\n\nThe ability to deduct capital losses may be limited.\n\nIn addition, if a shareholder realizes a loss on the redemption or exchange of a fund\u2019s shares and receives securities that are considered substantially identical to that fund\u2019s shares or reinvests in that fund\u2019s shares or substantially identical shares within 30 days before or after the redemption or exchange, the transactions may be subject to the \u201cwash sale\u201d rules, resulting in a postponement of the recognition of such loss for tax purposes.\n\nBackup Withholding.", "The Fund may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) (\u201cbackup withholding\u201d) from all taxable distributions payable to (1) any shareholder who fails to furnish the Fund with its correct taxpayer identification number or a certificate that the shareholder is exempt from backup withholding, and (2) any shareholder with respect to whom the IRS notifies the Fund that the shareholder has failed to properly report certain interest and dividend income to the IRS and to respond to notices to that effect.\n\nAn individual\u2019s taxpayer identification number is his or her social security number.\n\nThe 24% backup withholding tax is not an additional tax and may be credited against a taxpayer\u2019s regular federal income tax liability.\n\nShareholders are advised to consult their own tax advisers with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Fund.\n\nUNDERWRITERS\n\nThe Fund\u2019s shares are offered to the public on a continuous basis.", "The Distributor, as the principal underwriter of the shares, has certain obligations under the Distribution Agreement concerning the distribution of the shares.\n\nThese obligations and the compensation the Distributor receives are described above in the sections titled \u201cPrincipal Underwriter\u201d and \u201cRule 12b-1 Plan.\u201d\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nPERFORMANCE DATA\n\nAverage annual returns assuming deduction of maximum sales

including financial advisory services, investment management activities, lending, commercial banking, sponsoring and managing private investment funds, engaging in broker-dealer transactions and principal securities, commodities and foreign exchange transactions, research publication and other activities.\n\nIn the ordinary course of its business, Morgan Stanley is a full-service investment banking and financial services firm and therefore engages in activities where Morgan Stanley\u2019s interests or the interests of its clients may conflict with the interests of the Fund.", "Morgan Stanley advises clients and sponsors, manages or advises other investment funds and investment programs, accounts and businesses (collectively, together with the Morgan Stanley Funds, any new or successor funds, programs, accounts or businesses (other than funds, programs, accounts or businesses sponsored, managed, or advised by former direct or indirect subsidiaries of Eaton Vance Corp. (\u201cEaton Vance Investment Accounts\u201d)), the \u2018\u2018MS Investment Accounts\u201d, and, together with the Eaton Vance Investment Accounts, the \u201cAffiliated Investment Accounts\u2019\u2019) with a wide variety of investment objectives that in some instances may overlap or conflict with the Fund\u2019s investment objectives and present conflicts of interest.\n\nIn addition, Morgan Stanley or the Adviser may also from time to time create new or successor Affiliated Investment Accounts that may compete with the Fund and present similar conflicts of interest.", "The discussion below enumerates certain actual, apparent and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThere is no assurance that conflicts of interest will be resolved in favor of Fund shareholders and, in fact, they may not be.\n\nConflicts of interest not described below may also exist.\n\nThe discussions below with respect to actual, apparent and potential conflicts of interest also may be applicable to or arise from the Eaton Vance Investment Accounts whether or not specifically identified.\n\nMaterial Non-public and Other Information.\n\nIt is expected that confidential or material non-public information regarding an investment or potential investment opportunity may become available to the Adviser.\n\nIf such information becomes available, the Adviser may be precluded (including by applicable law or internal policies or procedures) from pursuing an investment or disposition opportunity with respect to such investment or investment opportunity.", "The Adviser may also from time to time be subject to contractual \u2018\u2018stand-still\u2019\u2019 obligations and/or confidentiality obligations that may restrict its ability to trade in certain investments on the Fund\u2019s behalf.\n\nIn addition, the Adviser may be precluded from disclosing such information to an investment team, even in circumstances in which the information would be beneficial if disclosed.\n\nTherefore, the investment team may not be provided access to material non-public information in the possession of Morgan Stanley that might be relevant to an investment decision to be made on behalf of the Fund, and the investment team may initiate a transaction or sell an investment that, if such information had been known to it, may not have been undertaken.", "In addition, certain members of the investment team may be recused from certain investment-related discussions so that such members do not receive information that would limit their ability to perform functions of their employment with the Adviser or its affiliates unrelated to that of the Fund.\n\nFurthermore, access to certain parts of Morgan Stanley may be subject to third party confidentiality obligations and to information barriers established by Morgan Stanley in order to manage potential conflicts of interest and regulatory restrictions, including without limitation joint transaction restrictions pursuant to the 1940 Act.\n\nAccordingly, the Adviser\u2019s ability to source investments from other business units within Morgan Stanley may be limited and there can be no assurance that the Adviser will be able to source any investments from any one or more parts of the Morgan Stanley network.", "The Adviser may restrict its investment decisions and activities on behalf of the Fund in various circumstances, including because of applicable regulatory requirements or information held by the Adviser or Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe Adviser might not engage in transactions or other activities for, or enforce certain rights in favor of, the Fund due to Morgan Stanley\u2019s activities outside the Fund.\n\nIn instances where trading of an investment is restricted, the Adviser may not be able to purchase or sell such investment on behalf of the Fund, resulting in the Fund\u2019s inability to participate in certain desirable transactions.\n\nThis inability to buy or sell an investment could have an adverse effect on the Fund\u2019s portfolio due to, among other things, changes in an investment\u2019s value during the period its trading is restricted.", "Also, in situations where the Adviser is required to aggregate its positions with those of other Morgan Stanley business units for position limit calculations, the Adviser may have to refrain from making investments due to the positions held by other Morgan Stanley business units or their clients.\n\nThere may be other situations where the Adviser refrains from making an investment due to additional disclosure obligations, regulatory requirements, policies, and reputational risk, or the Adviser may limit purchases or sales of securities in respect of which Morgan Stanley is engaged in an underwriting or other distribution capacity.\n\nMorgan Stanley has established certain information barriers and other policies to address the sharing of information between different businesses within Morgan Stanley.", "As a result of information barriers, the Adviser generally will not have access, or will have limited access, to certain information and personnel in other areas of Morgan Stanley and generally will not manage the Fund with the benefit of the information held by such other areas.\n\nMorgan Stanley, due to its access to and knowledge of funds, markets and securities based on its prime brokerage and other businesses, may make decisions based on information or take (or refrain from taking) actions with respect to interests in investments of the kind held (directly or indirectly) by the Fund in a manner that may be adverse to the Fund, and will not have any obligation or other duty to share information with the Adviser.\n\nIn limited circumstances, however, including for purposes of managing business and reputational risk, and subject to policies and procedures and any applicable regulations, Morgan Stanley personnel, including personnel of the Adviser, on one side of an\n\nBack to Table of Contents", "information barrier may have access to information and personnel on the other side of the information barrier through \u201cwall crossings.\u201d\n\nThe Adviser faces conflicts of interest in determining whether to engage in such wall crossings.\n\nInformation obtained in connection with such wall crossings may limit or restrict the ability of the Adviser to engage in or otherwise effect transactions on behalf of the Fund (including purchasing or selling securities that the Adviser may otherwise have purchased or sold for the Fund in the absence of a wall crossing).\n\nIn managing conflicts of interest that arise because of the foregoing, the Adviser generally will be subject to fiduciary requirements.\n\nThe Adviser may also implement internal information barriers or ethical walls, and the conflicts described herein with respect to information barriers and otherwise with respect to Morgan Stanley and the Adviser will also apply internally within the Adviser.", "As a result, the Fund may not be permitted to transact in (e.g., dispose of a security in whole or in part) during periods when it otherwise would have been able to do so, which could adversely affect the Fund.\n\nOther investors in the security that are not subject to such restrictions may be able to transact in the security during such periods.\n\nThere may also be circumstances in which, as a result of information held by certain portfolio management teams in the Adviser, the Adviser limits an activity or transaction for the Fund, including if the Fund is managed by a portfolio management team other than the team holding such information.\n\nInvestments by Morgan Stanley and its Affiliated Investment Accounts.", "In serving in multiple capacities to Affiliated Investment Accounts, Morgan Stanley, including the Adviser and its investment teams, may have obligations to other clients or investors in Affiliated Investment Accounts, the fulfillment of which may not be in the best interests of the Fund or its shareholders.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s investment objectives may overlap with the investment objectives of certain Affiliated Investment Accounts.\n\nAs a result, the members of an investment team may face conflicts in the allocation of investment opportunities among the Fund and other investment funds, programs, accounts and businesses advised by or affiliated with the Adviser.\n\nCertain Affiliated Investment Accounts may provide for higher management or incentive fees or greater expense reimbursements or overhead allocations, all of which may contribute to this conflict of interest and create an incentive for the Adviser to favor such other accounts.", "Morgan Stanley currently invests and plans to continue to invest on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliated Investment Accounts in a wide variety of investment opportunities globally.\n\nMorgan Stanley and its Affiliated Investment Accounts, to the extent consistent with applicable law and policies and procedures, will be permitted to invest in investment opportunities without making such opportunities available to the Fund beforehand.\n\nSubject to the foregoing, Morgan Stanley may offer investments that fall into the investment objectives of an Affiliated Investment Account to such account or make such investment on its own behalf, even though such investment also falls within the Fund\u2019s investment objectives.\n\nThe Fund may invest in opportunities that Morgan Stanley and/or one or more Affiliated Investment Accounts has declined, and vice versa.", "All of the foregoing may reduce the number of investment opportunities available to the Fund and may create conflicts of interest in allocating investment opportunities.\n\nInvestors should note that the conflicts inherent in making such allocation decisions may not always be resolved to the Fund\u2019s advantage.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Fund will have an opportunity to participate in certain opportunities that fall within their investment objectives.\n\nTo seek to reduce potential conflicts of interest and to attempt to allocate such investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, the Adviser has implemented allocation policies and procedures.\n\nThese policies and procedures are intended to give all clients of the Adviser, including the Fund, fair access to investment opportunities consistent with the requirements of organizational documents, investment strategies, applicable laws and regulations, and the fiduciary duties of the Adviser.", "Each client of the Adviser that is subject to the allocation policies and procedures, including the Fund, is assigned an investment team and portfolio manager(s) by the Adviser.\n\nThe investment team and portfolio managers review investment opportunities and will decide with respect to the allocation of each opportunity considering various factors and in accordance with the allocation policies and procedures.\n\nThe allocation policies and procedures are subject to change.\n\nInvestors should note that the conflicts inherent in making such allocation decisions may not always be resolved to the advantage of the Fund.\n\nIt is possible that Morgan Stanley or an Affiliated Investment Account, including another Morgan Stanley Fund, will invest in or advise (in the case of Morgan Stanley) a company that is or becomes a competitor of a company of which the Fund holds an investment.", "Such investment could create a conflict between the Fund, on the one hand, and Morgan Stanley or the Affiliated Investment Account, on the other hand.\n\nIn such a situation, Morgan Stanley may also have a conflict in the allocation of its own resources to the portfolio investment.\n\nFurthermore, certain Affiliated Investment Accounts will be focused primarily on investing in other funds which may have strategies that overlap and/or directly conflict and compete with the Fund.\n\nIn addition, certain investment professionals who are involved in the Fund\u2019s activities remain responsible for the investment activities of other Affiliated Investment Accounts managed by the Adviser and its affiliates, and they will devote time to the management of such investments and other newly created Affiliated Investment Accounts (whether in the form of funds, separate accounts or other vehicles), as well as their own investments.", "In addition, in connection with the management of investments for other Affiliated Investment Accounts, members of Morgan Stanley and its affiliates may serve on the boards of directors of or advise companies which may compete with the Fund\u2019s portfolio investments.\n\nMoreover, these Affiliated Investment Accounts managed by Morgan Stanley and its affiliates may pursue investment opportunities that may also be suitable for the Fund.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nIt should be noted that Morgan Stanley may, directly or indirectly, make large investments in certain of its Affiliated Investment Accounts, and accordingly Morgan Stanley\u2019s investment in the Fund may not be a determining factor in the outcome of any of the foregoing conflicts.", "Nothing herein restricts or in any way limits the activities of Morgan Stanley, including its ability to buy or sell interests in, or provide financing to, equity and/or debt instruments, funds or portfolio companies, for its own accounts or for the accounts of Affiliated Investment Accounts or other investment funds or clients in accordance with applicable law.\n\nDifferent clients of the Adviser, including the Fund, may invest in different classes of securities of the same issuer, depending on the respective clients\u2019 investment objectives and policies.\n\nAs a result, the Adviser and its affiliates, at times, will seek to satisfy fiduciary obligations to certain clients owning one class of securities of a particular issuer by pursuing or enforcing rights on behalf of those clients with respect to such class of securities, and those activities may have an adverse effect on another client which owns a different class of securities of such issuer.", "For example, if one client holds debt securities of an issuer and another client holds equity securities of the same issuer, if the issuer experiences financial or operational challenges, the Adviser and its affiliates may seek a liquidation of the issuer on behalf of the client that holds the debt securities, whereas the client holding the equity securities may benefit from a reorganization of the issuer.\n\nThus, in such situations, the actions taken by the Adviser or its affiliates on behalf of one client can negatively impact securities held by another client.\n\nThese conflicts also exist as between the Adviser\u2019s clients, including the Fund, and the Affiliated Investment Accounts managed by Eaton Vance.\n\nThe Adviser and its affiliates may give advice and recommend securities to other clients which may differ from advice given to, or securities recommended or bought for, the Fund even though such other clients\u2019 investment objectives may be similar to those of the Fund.", "The Adviser and its affiliates manage long and short portfolios.\n\nThe simultaneous management of long and short portfolios creates conflicts of interest in portfolio management and trading in that opposite directional positions may be taken in client accounts, including client accounts managed by the same investment team, and creates risks such as: (i) the risk that short sale activity could adversely affect the market value of long positions in one or more portfolios (and vice versa) and (ii) the risks associated with the trading desk receiving opposing orders in the same security simultaneously.\n\nThe Adviser and its affiliates have adopted policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to mitigate these conflicts.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the Adviser invests on behalf of itself in securities and other instruments that would be appropriate for, held by, or may fall within the investment guidelines of its clients, including the Fund.", "At times, the Adviser may give advice or take action for its own accounts that differs from, conflicts with, or is adverse to advice given or action taken for any client.\n\nFrom time to time, conflicts also arise due to the fact that certain securities or instruments may be held in some client accounts, including the Fund, but not in others, or that client accounts may have different levels of holdings in certain securities or instruments.\n\nIn addition, due to differences in the investment strategies or restrictions among client accounts, the Adviser may take action with respect to one account that differs from the action taken with respect to another account.\n\nIn some cases, a client account may compensate the Adviser based on the performance of the securities held by that account.\n\nThe existence of such a performance based fee may create additional conflicts of interest for the Adviser in the allocation of management time, resources and investment opportunities.", "The Adviser has adopted several policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts including a code of ethics and policies that govern the Adviser\u2019s trading practices, including, among other things, the aggregation and allocation of trades among clients, brokerage allocations, cross trades and best execution.\n\nIn addition, at times an investment team will give advice or take action with respect to the investments of one or more clients that is not given or taken with respect to other clients with similar investment programs, objectives, and strategies.\n\nAccordingly, clients with similar strategies will not always hold the same securities or instruments or achieve the same performance.\n\nThe Adviser\u2019s investment teams also advise clients with conflicting programs, objectives or strategies.\n\nThese conflicts also exist as between the Adviser\u2019s clients, including the Fund, and the Affiliated Investment Accounts managed by Eaton Vance.", "Morgan Stanley and its affiliates maintain separate trading desks that operate independently of each other and do not share information with the Adviser.\n\nThe Morgan Stanley and affiliate trading desks may compete against the Adviser trading desks when implementing buy and sell transactions, possibly causing certain Affiliated Investment Accounts to pay more or receive less for a security than other Affiliated Investment Accounts.\n\nInvestments by Separate Investment Departments.\n\nThe entities and individuals that provide investment-related services for the Fund and certain other MS Investment Accounts (the \u201cMS Investment Department\u201d) may be different from the entities and individuals that provide investment-related services to Eaton Vance Investment Accounts (the \u201cEaton Vance Investment Department\u201d and, together with the MS Investment Department, the \u201cInvestment Departments\u201d).", "Although Morgan Stanley has implemented information barriers between the Investment Departments in accordance with internal policies and procedures, each Investment Department may engage in discussions and share information and resources with the other Investment Department on certain investment-related matters.\n\nThe sharing of information and resources between the Investment Departments is designed to further increase the knowledge and effectiveness of each Investment Department.\n\nBecause each Investment Department generally makes investment decisions and executes trades independently of the other, the quality and price of execution, and the performance\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nof investments and accounts, can be expected to vary.\n\nIn addition, each Investment Department may use different trading systems and technology and may employ differing investment and trading strategies.", "As a result, an Eaton Vance Investment Account could trade in advance of the Fund (and vice versa), might complete trades more quickly and efficiently than the Fund, and/or achieve different execution than the Fund on the same or similar investments made contemporaneously, even when the Investment Departments shared research and viewpoints that led to that investment decision.\n\nAny sharing of information or resources between the Investment Department servicing the Fund and the Eaton Vance Investment Department may result, from time to time, in the Fund simultaneously or contemporaneously seeking to engage in the same or similar transactions as an account serviced by the other Investment Department and for which there are limited buyers or sellers on specific securities, which could result in less favorable execution for the Fund than such Affiliated Investment Account.", "The MS Investment Department will not knowingly or intentionally cause the Fund to engage in a cross trade with an account serviced by the Eaton Vance Investment Department, however, subject to applicable law and internal policies and procedures, the Fund may conduct cross trades with other accounts serviced by the MS Investment Department.\n\nAlthough the MS Investment Department may aggregate the Fund\u2019s trades with trades of other accounts serviced by the MS Investment Department, subject to applicable law and internal policies and procedures, there will be no aggregation or coordination of trades with accounts serviced by the Eaton Vance Investment Department, even when both Investment Departments are seeking to acquire or dispose of the same investments contemporaneously.\n\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries.", "The Adviser and/or the Distributor may pay compensation, out of their own funds and not as an expense of the Fund, to certain Financial Intermediaries (which may include affiliates of the Adviser and the Distributor), including recordkeepers and administrators of various deferred compensation plans, in connection with the sale, distribution, marketing and retention of shares of the Fund and/or shareholder servicing.", "For example, the Adviser or the Distributor may pay additional compensation to a Financial Intermediary for, among other things, promoting the sale and distribution of Fund shares, providing access to various programs, mutual fund platforms or preferred or recommended mutual fund lists that may be offered by a Financial Intermediary, granting the Distributor access to a Financial Intermediary\u2019s financial advisors and consultants, providing assistance in the ongoing education and training of a Financial Intermediary\u2019s financial personnel, furnishing marketing support, maintaining share balances and/or for sub-accounting, recordkeeping, administrative, shareholder or transaction processing services.\n\nSuch payments are in addition to any distribution fees, shareholder servicing fees and/or transfer agency fees that may be payable by the Fund.", "The additional payments may be based on various factors, including level of sales (based on gross or net sales or some specified minimum sales or some other similar criteria related to sales of the Fund and/or some or all other Morgan Stanley Funds), amount of assets invested by the Financial Intermediary\u2019s customers (which could include current or aged assets of the Fund and/or some or all other Morgan Stanley Funds), the Fund\u2019s advisory fee, some other agreed upon amount or other measures as determined from time to time by the Adviser and/or the Distributor.\n\nThe amount of these payments may be different for different Financial Intermediaries.", "The prospect of receiving, or the receipt of, additional compensation, as described above, by Financial Intermediaries may provide such Financial Intermediaries and their financial advisors and other salespersons with an incentive to favor sales of shares of the Fund over other investment options with respect to which these Financial Intermediaries do not receive additional compensation (or receives lower levels of additional compensation).\n\nThese payment arrangements, however, will not change the price that an investor pays for shares of the Fund or the amount that the Fund receives to invest on behalf of an investor.\n\nInvestors may wish to take such payment arrangements into account when considering and evaluating any recommendations relating to Fund shares and should review carefully any disclosures provided by Financial Intermediaries as to their compensation.", "In addition, in certain circumstances, the Adviser restricts, limits or reduces the amount of the Fund\u2019s investment, or restricts the type of governance or voting rights it acquires or exercises, where the Fund (potentially together with Morgan Stanley) exceeds a certain ownership interest, or possesses certain degrees of voting or control or has other interests.\n\nMorgan Stanley Trading and Principal Investing Activities.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Morgan Stanley will generally conduct its sales and trading businesses, publish research and analysis, and render investment advice without regard for the Fund\u2019s holdings, although these activities could have an adverse impact on the value of one or more of the Fund\u2019s investments, or could cause Morgan Stanley to have an interest in one or more portfolio investments that is different from, and potentially adverse to that of the Fund.", "Furthermore, from time to time, the Adviser or its affiliates may invest \u201cseed\u201d capital in the Fund, typically to enable the Fund to commence investment operations and/or achieve sufficient scale.\n\nThe Adviser and its affiliates may hedge such seed capital exposure by investing in derivatives or other instruments expected to produce offsetting exposure.\n\nSuch hedging transactions, if any, would occur outside of the Fund.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s sales and trading, financing and principal investing businesses (whether or not specifically identified as such, and including Morgan Stanley\u2019s trading and principal investing businesses) will not be required to offer any investment opportunities to the Fund.\n\nThese businesses may encompass, among other things, principal trading activities as well as principal investing.", "Morgan Stanley\u2019s sales and trading, financing and principal investing businesses have acquired or invested in, and in the future may acquire or invest in, minority and/or majority control positions in equity or debt instruments of diverse public and/or private companies.\n\nSuch activities may put Morgan Stanley in a position to exercise contractual, voting or creditor rights, or management or\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nother control with respect to securities or loans of portfolio investments or other issuers, and in these instances Morgan Stanley may, in its discretion and subject to applicable law, act to protect its own interests or interests of clients, and not the Fund\u2019s interests.\n\nSubject to the limitations of applicable law, the Fund may purchase from or sell assets to, or make investments in, companies in which Morgan Stanley has or may acquire an interest, including as an owner, creditor or counterparty.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Investment Banking and Other Commercial Activities.", "Morgan Stanley advises clients on a variety of mergers, acquisitions, restructuring, bankruptcy and financing transactions.\n\nMorgan Stanley may act as an advisor to clients, including other investment funds that may compete with the Fund and with respect to investments that the Fund may hold.\n\nMorgan Stanley may give advice and take action with respect to any of its clients or proprietary accounts that may differ from the advice given, or may involve an action of a different timing or nature than the action taken, by the Fund.\n\nMorgan Stanley may give advice and provide recommendations to persons competing with the Fund and/or any of the Fund\u2019s investments that are contrary to the Fund\u2019s best interests and/or the best interests of any of its investments.", "Morgan Stanley could be engaged in financial advising, whether on the buy-side or sell-side, or in financing or lending assignments that could result in Morgan Stanley\u2019s determining in its discretion or being required to act exclusively on behalf of one or more third parties, which could limit the Fund\u2019s ability to transact with respect to one or more existing or potential investments.\n\nMorgan Stanley may have relationships with third-party funds, companies or investors who may have invested in or may look to invest in portfolio companies, and there could be conflicts between the Fund\u2019s best interests, on the one hand, and the interests of a Morgan Stanley client or counterparty, on the other hand.", "To the extent that Morgan Stanley advises creditor or debtor companies in the financial restructuring of companies either prior to or after filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or similar laws in other jurisdictions, the Adviser\u2019s flexibility in making investments in such restructurings on the Fund\u2019s behalf may be limited.\n\nMorgan Stanley could provide investment banking services to competitors of portfolio companies, as well as to private equity and/or private credit funds; such activities may present Morgan Stanley with a conflict of interest vis-a-vis the Fund\u2019s investment and may also result in a conflict in respect of the allocation of investment banking resources to portfolio companies.", "To the extent permitted by applicable law, Morgan Stanley may provide a broad range of financial services to companies in which the Fund invests, including strategic and financial advisory services, interim acquisition financing and other lending and underwriting or placement of securities, and Morgan Stanley generally will be paid fees (that may include warrants or other securities) for such services.\n\nMorgan Stanley will not share any of the foregoing interest, fees and other compensation received by it (including, for the avoidance of doubt, amounts received by the Adviser) with the Fund, and any advisory fees payable will not be reduced thereby.", "Morgan Stanley may be engaged to act as a financial advisor to a company in connection with the sale of such company, or subsidiaries or divisions thereof, may represent potential buyers of businesses through its mergers and acquisition activities and may provide lending and other related financing services in connection with such transactions.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s compensation for such activities is usually based upon realized consideration and is usually contingent, in substantial part, upon the closing of the transaction.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Fund may be precluded from participating in a transaction with or relating to the company being sold or participating in any financing activity related to merger or acquisition.\n\nThe involvement or presence of Morgan Stanley in the investment banking and other commercial activities described above (or the financial markets more broadly) may restrict or otherwise limit investment opportunities that may otherwise be available to the Fund.", "For example, issuers may hire and compensate Morgan Stanley to provide underwriting, financial advisory, placement agency, brokerage services or other services and, because of limitations imposed by applicable law and regulation, the Fund may be prohibited from buying or selling securities issued by those issuers or participating in related transactions or otherwise limited in its ability to engage in such investments.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Marketing Activities.\n\nMorgan Stanley is engaged in the business of underwriting, syndicating, brokering, administering, servicing, arranging and advising on the distribution of a wide variety of securities and other investments in which the Fund may invest.", "Subject to the restrictions of the 1940 Act, including Sections 10(f) and 17(e) thereof, the Fund may invest in transactions in which Morgan Stanley acts as underwriter, placement agent, syndicator, broker, administrative agent, servicer, advisor, arranger or structuring agent and receives fees or other compensation from the sponsors of such products or securities.\n\nAny fees earned by Morgan Stanley in such capacity will not be shared with the Adviser or the Fund.\n\nCertain conflicts of interest, in addition to the receipt of fees or other compensation, would be inherent in these transactions.\n\nMoreover, the interests of one of Morgan Stanley\u2019s clients with respect to an issuer of securities in which the Fund has an investment may be adverse to the Adviser\u2019s or the Fund\u2019s best interests.\n\nIn conducting the foregoing activities, Morgan Stanley will be acting for its other clients and will have no obligation to act in the Adviser\u2019s or the Fund\u2019s best interests.\n\nClient Relationships.", "Morgan Stanley has existing and potential relationships with a significant number of corporations, institutions and individuals.\n\nIn providing services to its clients, Morgan Stanley may face conflicts of interest with respect to activities recommended to or performed for such clients, on the one hand, and the Fund, its shareholders or the entities in which the Fund\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\ninvests, on the other hand.\n\nIn addition, these client relationships may present conflicts of interest in determining whether to offer certain investment opportunities to the Fund.\n\nIn acting as principal or in providing advisory and other services to its other clients, Morgan Stanley may engage in or recommend activities with respect to a particular matter that conflict with or are different from activities engaged in or recommended by the Adviser on the Fund\u2019s behalf.\n\nPrincipal Investments.", "To the extent permitted by applicable law, there may be situations in which the Fund\u2019s interests may conflict with the interests of one or more general accounts of Morgan Stanley and its affiliates or accounts managed by Morgan Stanley or its affiliates.\n\nThis may occur because these accounts hold public and private debt and equity securities of many issuers which may be or become portfolio companies, or from whom portfolio companies may be acquired.\n\nTransactions with Portfolio Companies of Affiliated Investment Accounts.\n\nThe companies in which the Fund may invest may be counterparties to or participants in agreements, transactions or other arrangements with portfolio companies or other entities of portfolio investments of Affiliated Investment Accounts (for example, a company in which the Fund invests may retain a company in which an Affiliated Investment Account invests to provide services or may acquire an asset from such company or vice versa).", "Certain of these agreements, transactions and arrangements involve fees, servicing payments, rebates and/or other benefits to Morgan Stanley or its affiliates.\n\nFor example, portfolio entities may, including at the encouragement of Morgan Stanley, enter into agreements regarding group procurement and/or vendor discounts.\n\nMorgan Stanley and its affiliates may also participate in these agreements and may realize better pricing or discounts as a result of the participation of portfolio entities.\n\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, certain of these agreements may provide for commissions or similar payments and/or discounts or rebates to be paid to a portfolio entity of an Affiliated Investment Account, and such payments or discounts or rebates may also be made directly to Morgan Stanley or its affiliates.", "Under these arrangements, a particular portfolio company or other entity may benefit to a greater degree than the other participants, and the Morgan Stanley Funds, investment vehicles and accounts (which may or may not include the Fund) that own an interest in such entity will receive a greater relative benefit from the arrangements than the Morgan Stanley Funds, investment vehicles or accounts that do not own an interest therein.\n\nFees and compensation received by portfolio companies of Affiliated Investment Accounts in relation to the foregoing will not be shared with the Fund or offset advisory fees payable.\n\nInvestments in Portfolio Investments of Other Funds.\n\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, when the Fund invests in certain companies or other entities, other funds affiliated with the Adviser may have made or may be making an investment in such companies or other entities.", "Other funds that have been or may be managed by the Adviser may invest in the companies or other entities in which the Fund has made an investment.\n\nUnder such circumstances, the Fund and such other funds may have conflicts of interest (e.g., over the terms, exit strategies and related matters, including the exercise of remedies of their respective investments).\n\nIf the interests held by the Fund are different from (or take priority over) those held by such other funds, the Adviser may be required to make a selection at the time of conflicts between the interests held by such other funds and the interests held by the Fund.\n\nAllocation of Expenses.\n\nExpenses may be incurred that are attributable to the Fund and one or more other Affiliated Investment Accounts (including in connection with issuers in which the Fund and such other Affiliated Investment Accounts have overlapping investments).\n\nThe allocation of such expenses among such entities raises potential conflicts of interest.", "The Adviser and its affiliates intend to allocate such common expenses among the Fund and any such other Affiliated Investment Accounts on a pro rata basis or in such other manner as the Adviser deems to be fair and equitable or in such other manner as may be required by applicable law.\n\nTemporary Investments.\n\nTo more efficiently invest short-term cash balances held by the Fund, the Adviser may invest such balances on an overnight \u201csweep\u201d basis in shares of one or more money market funds or other short-term vehicles.\n\nIt is anticipated that the investment adviser to these money market funds or other short-term vehicles may be the Adviser (or an affiliate) to the extent permitted by applicable law, including Rule 12d1-1 under the 1940 Act.\n\nIn such a case, the affiliated investment adviser may receive asset-based fees in respect of the Fund\u2019s investment (which will reduce the net return realized by the Fund).\n\nTransactions with Affiliates.", "The Adviser and any investment sub-adviser might purchase securities from underwriters or placement agents in which a Morgan Stanley affiliate is a member of a syndicate or selling group, as a result of which an affiliate might benefit from the purchase through receipt of a fee or otherwise.\n\nNeither the Adviser nor any investment sub-adviser will purchase securities on behalf of the Fund from an affiliate that is acting as a manager of a syndicate or selling group.\n\nPurchases by the Adviser on behalf of the Fund from an affiliate acting as a placement agent must meet the requirements of applicable law.\n\nFurthermore, Morgan Stanley may face conflicts of interest when the Fund uses service providers affiliated with Morgan Stanley because Morgan Stanley receives greater overall fees when they are used.\n\nGeneral Process for Potential Conflicts.", "All of the transactions described above involve the potential for conflicts of interest between the Adviser, related persons of the Adviser and/or their clients.\n\nThe Advisers Act, the 1940 Act and ERISA impose certain requirements designed to decrease the possibility of conflicts of interest between an investment adviser and its clients.\n\nIn some cases, transactions may be permitted subject to fulfillment of certain conditions.\n\nCertain other transactions may be prohibited.\n\nIn addition, the Adviser has instituted policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from arising and, when they do arise, to ensure that it effects transactions for clients in a manner that is consistent with its fiduciary duty to its clients and in accordance with\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\napplicable law.\n\nThe Adviser seeks to ensure that potential or actual conflicts of interest are appropriately resolved taking into consideration the overriding best interests of the client.\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS", "[The Fund\u2019s audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023,

GENERAL PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES", "Morgan Stanley Investment Management (\u201cMSIM\u201d) and its affiliates1 will vote proxies in a prudent and diligent manner and in the best interests of clients in accordance with their fiduciary duties, including beneficiaries of and participants in a client\u2019s benefit plan(s) for which MSIM manages assets, consistent with the objective of maximizing long-term investment returns (\u201cClient Proxy Standard\u201d) and this Policy.2\n\nMSIM has a decentralized approach towards investment management, consisting of independent investment teams.\n\nAccordingly, this Policy serves as guidance for MSIM investment teams addressing a broad range of issues, and general voting parameters on proposals that arise most frequently.", "MSIM investment teams endeavor to integrate this Policy with their investment goals and client expectations, using their vote to encourage portfolio companies to enhance long-term shareholder value and to provide a high standard of transparency such that equity markets can value corporate assets appropriately.\n\nAs such, MSIM investment teams seek to follow the Client Proxy Standard for each client.\n\nAt times, this may result in split votes, for example when different vehicles/products and clients have varying economic interests and / or priorities reflected in their mandates with respect to the outcome of a particular voting matter.\n\nVoting Proxies for Certain Non-U.S. Companies\n\nVoting proxies of companies located in some jurisdictions may involve several problems that can restrict or prevent the ability to vote such proxies or entail significant costs.", "These problems include, but are not limited to: (i) proxy statements and ballots being written in a language other than English; (ii) untimely and/or inadequate notice of shareholder meetings; (iii) restrictions on the ability of holders outside the issuer\u2019s jurisdiction of organization to exercise votes; (iv) requirements to vote proxies in person; (v) the imposition of restrictions on the sale of the securities for a period of time in proximity to the shareholder meeting; and (vi) requirements to provide local agents with power of attorney to facilitate our voting instructions.\n\nAs a result, we vote clients\u2019 non-U.S. proxies on a best efforts basis only, after weighing the costs and benefits of voting such proxies, consistent with the Client Proxy Standard.\n\nInstitutional Shareholder Services (\u201cISS\u201d) has been retained to provide assistance in connection with voting non-U.S. proxies.\n\nSecurities Lending", "MS Funds or any other investment vehicle sponsored, managed or advised by an MSIM affiliate may participate in a securities lending program through a third party provider.\n\nThe voting rights for shares that are out on loan are transferred to the borrower and therefore, the lender (i.e., an MS Fund or another investment vehicle sponsored, managed or advised by an MSIM affiliate) is not entitled to vote the lent shares at the company meeting.\n\nHowever, in certain circumstances a portfolio manager may seek to recall shares for the purposes of voting.\n\nIn this event, the handling of such recall requests would be on a best efforts basis.\n\n1 | The MSIM entities covered by this Equity Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) currently include the following: Morgan Stanley AIP GP LP, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., Morgan Stanley Investment Management Limited, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Company, Morgan Stanley Saudi Arabia,", "MSIM Fund Management (Ireland) Limited, Morgan Stanley Asia Limited, Morgan Stanley Investment Management\n\n(Japan) Co.\n\nLimited, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Private Limited, Morgan Stanley Eaton Vance CLO Manager LLC, Morgan Stanley Eaton Vance CLO CM LLC and FundLogic SAS (each an \u201cMSIM Affiliate\u201d and collectively referred to as the \u201cMSIM Affiliates\u201d or as \u201cwe\u201d below).\n\n2 | This Policy does not apply to MSIM\u2019s authority to exercise certain decision-making rights associated with investments in loans and other fixed-income instruments (collectively, \u201cFixed Income Instruments\u201d).\n\nInstead, MSIM\u2019s Policy for Exercising Consents Related to Fixed Income Instruments applies to MSIM\u2019s exercise of discretionary authority or other investment management services, to the extent MSIM has been granted authority to exercise consents for an account with respect to any Fixed Income Instruments held therein.\n\nA. Routine Matters.\n\nWe generally support routine management proposals.", "The following are examples of routine management proposals:\n\n\u25a0 |  Approval of financial statements and auditor reports if delivered with an unqualified auditor\u2019s opinion.\n\n\u25a0 |  General updating/corrective amendments to the charter, articles of association or bylaws, unless we believe that such amendments would diminish shareholder rights.\n\nMost proposals related to the conduct of the annual meeting, with the following exceptions.\n\nWe generally oppose proposals that relate to \u201cthe transaction of such other business which may come before the meeting,\u201d and open-ended requests for adjournment.\n\nHowever, where management specifically states the reason for requesting an adjournment and the requested adjournment would facilitate passage of a proposal that would otherwise be supported under this Policy (i.e., an uncontested corporate transaction), the adjournment request will be supported.\n\nWe do not support proposals that allow companies to call a special meeting with a short\n\nBack to Table of Contents", "(generally two weeks or less) time frame for review.\n\nWe generally support shareholder proposals advocating confidential voting procedures and independent tabulation of voting results.\n\nMSIM is supportive of the use of technology to conduct virtual shareholder meetings in parallel with physical meetings, for increased investor participation.\n\nHowever, adoption of a \u2018virtual-only\u2019 approach would restrict meaningful exchange between the company and shareholders.\n\nTherefore, MSIM is generally not supportive of proposals seeking authority to conduct virtual-only shareholder meetings.\n\nB. Board of Directors.\n\n1 | Election of Directors: Votes on board nominees can involve balancing a variety of considerations.\n\nIn vote decisions, we may take into consideration whether the company has a majority voting policy in place that we believe makes the director vote more meaningful.\n\nIn the absence of a proxy contest, we generally support the board\u2019s nominees for director except as follows:", "a | We consider withholding support from or voting against a nominee if we believe a direct conflict exists between the interests of the nominee and the public shareholders, including failure to meet fiduciary standards of care and/or loyalty.\n\nWe may oppose directors where we conclude that actions of directors are unlawful, unethical or negligent.\n\nWe consider opposing individual board members or an entire slate if we believe the board is entrenched and/or dealing inadequately with performance problems; if we believe the board is acting with insufficient independence between the board and management; or if we believe the board has not been sufficiently forthcoming with information on key governance or other matters we believe could be financially material.\n\nb | We consider withholding support from or voting against interested directors if the company\u2019s board does not meet market standards for director independence, or if otherwise we believe board independence is insufficient.", "We refer to prevalent market standards as promulgated by a stock exchange or other authority within a given market (e.g., New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq rules for most U.S. companies, and The Combined Code on Corporate Governance in the United Kingdom).\n\nThus, for an NYSE company with no controlling shareholder, we would expect that at a minimum a majority of directors should be independent as defined by NYSE.\n\nWhere we view market standards as inadequate, we may withhold votes based on stronger independence standards.\n\nMarket standards notwithstanding, we generally do not view long board tenure alone as a basis to classify a director as non-independent.", "i | At a company with a shareholder or group that controls the company by virtue of a majority economic interest in the company, we have a reduced expectation for board independence, although we believe the presence of independent directors can be helpful, particularly in staffing the audit committee, and at times we may withhold support from or vote against a nominee on the view the board or its committees are not sufficiently independent.\n\nIn markets where board independence is not the norm, however, we consider factors including whether a board of a controlled company includes independent members who can be expected to look out for interests of minority holders.\n\nii | We consider withholding support from or voting against a nominee if he or she is affiliated with a major shareholder that has representation on a board disproportionate to its economic interest.", "c | Depending on market standards, we consider withholding support from or voting against a nominee who is interested and who is standing for election as a member of the company\u2019s compensation/remuneration, nominating/governance or audit committee.\n\nd | We consider withholding support from or voting against nominees if the term for which they are nominated is excessive.\n\nWe consider this issue on a market-specific basis.\n\ne | We consider withholding support from or voting against nominees if in our view there has been insufficient board renewal (turnover), particularly in the context of extended poor company performance.\n\nAlso, if the board has failed to consider diversity, including but not limited to, gender and ethnicity, in its board composition.\n\nf\n\n| We consider withholding support from or voting against a nominee standing for election if the board has not taken action to implement generally accepted governance practices for which there is a \u201cbright line\u201d test.", "For example, in the context of the U.S. market, failure to eliminate a dead hand or slow hand poison pill would be seen as a basis for opposing one or more incumbent nominees.\n\ng | In markets that encourage designated audit committee financial experts, we consider voting against members of an audit committee if no members are designated as such.\n\nWe also consider voting against the audit committee members if the company has faced financial reporting issues and/or does not put the auditor up for ratification by shareholders.\n\nh | We believe investors should have the ability to vote on individual nominees, and may abstain or vote against a slate of nominees where we are not given the opportunity to vote on individual nominees.\n\ni | We consider withholding support from or voting against a nominee who has failed to attend at least 75% of the nominee\u2019s board and board committee meetings within a given year without a reasonable excuse.", "We also consider opposing nominees if the company does not meet market standards for disclosure on attendance.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nj\n\n| We consider withholding support from or voting against a nominee who appears overcommitted, particularly through service on an excessive number of boards.\n\nMarket expectations are incorporated into this analysis; for U.S. boards, we generally oppose election of a nominee who serves on more than four public company boards (excluding investment companies), or public company CEOs that serve on more than two outside boards given level of time commitment required in their primary job.\n\nk | We consider withholding support from or voting against a nominee where we believe executive remuneration practices are poor, particularly if the company does not offer shareholders a separate \u201csay-on-pay\u201d advisory vote on pay.", "2 | Discharge of Directors\u2019 Duties: In markets where an annual discharge of directors\u2019 responsibility is a routine agenda item, we generally support such discharge.\n\nHowever, we may vote against discharge or abstain from voting where there are serious findings of fraud or other unethical behavior for which the individual bears responsibility.\n\nThe annual discharge of responsibility represents shareholder approval of disclosed actions taken by the board during the year and may make future shareholder action against the board difficult to pursue.\n\n3 | Board Independence: We generally support U.S. shareholder proposals requiring that a certain percentage (up to 66\u2154%) of the company\u2019s board members be independent directors, and promoting all-independent audit, compensation and nominating/governance committees.\n\n4 | Board Diversity: We believe that board diversity is a potentially financially material issue.", "As such we generally support shareholder proposals urging diversity of board membership with respect to gender, race or other factors where we believe the board has failed to take these factors into account.\n\nWe will also consider not supporting the re-election of the nomination committee and / or chair (or other resolutions when the nomination chair is not up for re-election) where we perceive limited progress in gender diversity, with the expectation where feasible and with consideration of any idiosyncrasies of individual markets, that female directors represent not less than a third of the board, unless there is evidence that the company has made significant progress in this area.", "In markets where information on director ethnicity is available, and it is legal to obtain it, and where it is relevant, we will generally also consider not supporting the re-election of the nomination committee chair (or other resolutions when the nomination chair is not up for re-election) if the board lacks ethnic diversity and has not outlined a credible diversity strategy.\n\n5 | Majority Voting: We generally support proposals requesting or requiring majority voting policies in election of directors, so long as there is a carve-out for plurality voting in the case of contested elections.\n\n6 | Proxy Access: We consider proposals on procedures for inclusion of shareholder nominees and to have those nominees included in the company\u2019s proxy statement and on the company\u2019s proxy ballot on a case-by-case basis.\n\nConsiderations include ownership thresholds, holding periods, the number of directors that shareholders may nominate and any restrictions on forming a group.", "7 | Reimbursement for Dissident Nominees: We generally support well-crafted U.S. shareholder proposals that would provide for reimbursement of dissident nominees elected to a board, as the cost to shareholders in electing such nominees can be factored into the voting decision on those nominees.\n\n8 | Proposals to Elect Directors More Frequently: In the U.S. public company context, we usually support shareholder and management proposals to elect all directors annually (to \u201cdeclassify\u201d the board), although we make an exception to this policy where we believe that long-term shareholder value may be harmed by this change given particular circumstances at the company at the time of the vote on such proposal.", "As indicated above, outside the United States we generally support greater accountability to shareholders that comes through more frequent director elections, but recognize that many markets embrace longer term lengths, sometimes for valid reasons given other aspects of the legal context in electing boards.\n\n9 | Cumulative Voting: We generally support proposals to eliminate cumulative voting in the U.S. market context.\n\n(Cumulative voting provides that shareholders may concentrate their votes for one or a handful of candidates, a system that can enable a minority bloc to place representation on a board.)\n\nU.S. proposals to establish cumulative voting in the election of directors generally will not be supported.\n\n10 | Separation of Chairman and CEO Positions: We vote on shareholder proposals to separate the Chairman and CEO positions and/or to appoint an independent Chairman based in part on prevailing practice in particular markets, since the context for such a practice varies.", "In many non-U.S. markets, we view separation of the roles as a market standard practice, and support division of the roles in that context.\n\nIn the United States, we consider such proposals on a case-by-case basis, considering, among other things, the existing board leadership structure, company performance, and any evidence of entrenchment or perceived risk that power is overly concentrated in a single individual.\n\n11 | Director Retirement Age and Term Limits: Proposals setting or recommending director retirement ages or director term limits are voted on a case-by-case basis that includes consideration of company performance, the rate of board renewal, evidence of effective individual director evaluation processes, and any indications of entrenchment.", "12 | Proposals to Limit Directors\u2019 Liability and/or Broaden Indemnification of Officers and Directors: Generally, we will support such proposals provided that an individual is eligible only if he or she has not acted in bad faith, with gross negligence or with reckless disregard of their duties.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nC. Statutory Auditor Boards.\n\nThe statutory auditor board, which is separate from the main board of directors, plays a role in corporate governance in several markets.\n\nThese boards are elected by shareholders to provide assurance on compliance with legal and accounting standards and the company\u2019s articles of association.\n\nWe generally vote for statutory auditor nominees if they meet independence standards.\n\nIn markets that require disclosure on attendance by internal statutory auditors, however, we consider voting against nominees for these positions who failed to attend at least 75% of meetings in the previous year.", "We also consider opposing nominees if the company does not meet market standards for disclosure on attendance.\n\nD. Corporate Transactions and Proxy Fights.\n\nWe examine proposals relating to mergers, acquisitions and other special corporate transactions (i.e., takeovers, spin-offs, sales of assets, reorganizations, restructurings and recapitalizations) on a case-by-case basis in the interests of each fund or other account.\n\nProposals for mergers or other significant transactions that are friendly and approved by the Research Providers usually are supported if there is no portfolio manager objection.\n\nWe also analyze proxy contests on a case-by-case basis.\n\nE. Changes in Capital Structure.\n\nWe generally support the following:\n\n\u25a0 |  Management and shareholder proposals aimed at eliminating unequal voting rights, assuming fair economic treatment of classes of shares we hold.", "\u25a0 |  U.S. management proposals to increase the authorization of existing classes of common stock (or securities convertible into common stock)\n\nif: (i) a clear business purpose is stated that we can support and the number of shares requested is reasonable in relation to the purpose for which authorization is requested; and/or (ii) the authorization does not exceed 100% of shares currently authorized and at least 30% of the total new authorization will be outstanding.\n\n(We consider proposals that do not meet these criteria on a case-by-case basis.)\n\n\u25a0 |  U.S. management proposals to create a new class of preferred stock or for issuances of preferred stock up to 50% of issued capital, unless we have concerns about use of the authority for anti-takeover purposes.\n\n\u25a0 |  Proposals in non-U.S. markets that in our view appropriately limit potential dilution of existing shareholders.", "A major consideration is whether existing shareholders would have preemptive rights for any issuance under a proposal for standing share issuance authority.\n\nWe generally consider market-specific guidance in making these decisions; for example, in the U.K. market we usually follow Association of British Insurers\u2019 (\u201cABI\u201d) guidance, although company-specific factors may be considered and for example, may sometimes lead us to voting against share authorization proposals even if they meet ABI guidance.\n\n\u25a0 |  Management proposals to authorize share repurchase plans, except in some cases in which we believe there are insufficient protections against use of an authorization for anti-takeover purposes.\n\n\u25a0 |  Management proposals to reduce the number of authorized shares of common or preferred stock, or to eliminate classes of preferred stock.\n\n\u25a0 |  Management proposals to effect stock splits.", "\u25a0 |  Management proposals to effect reverse stock splits if management proportionately reduces the authorized share amount set forth in the corporate charter.\n\nReverse stock splits that do not adjust proportionately to the authorized share amount generally will be approved if the resulting increase in authorized shares coincides with the proxy guidelines set forth above for common stock increases.\n\n\u25a0 |  Management dividend payout proposals, except where we perceive company payouts to shareholders as inadequate.\n\nWe generally oppose the following (notwithstanding management support):\n\n\u25a0 |  Proposals to add classes of stock that would substantially dilute the voting interests of existing shareholders.\n\n\u25a0 |  Proposals to increase the authorized or issued number of shares of existing classes of stock that are unreasonably dilutive, particularly if there are no preemptive rights for existing shareholders.", "However, depending on market practices, we consider voting for proposals giving general authorization for issuance of shares not subject to pre-emptive rights if the authority is limited.\n\n\u25a0 |  Proposals that authorize share issuance at a discount to market rates, except where authority for such issuance is de minimis, or if there is a special situation that we believe justifies such authorization (as may be the case, for example, at a company under severe stress and risk of bankruptcy).\n\n\u25a0 |  Proposals relating to changes in capitalization by 100% or more.\n\nWe consider on a case-by-case basis shareholder proposals to increase dividend payout ratios, in light of market practice and perceived market weaknesses, as well as individual company payout history and current circumstances.", "For example, currently we perceive low payouts to shareholders as a concern at some Japanese companies, but may deem a low payout ratio as appropriate for a growth company making good use of its cash, notwithstanding the broader market concern.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nF. Takeover Defenses and Shareholder Rights.\n\n1 | Shareholder Rights Plans: We generally support proposals to require shareholder approval or ratification of shareholder rights plans (poison pills).", "In voting on rights plans or similar takeover defenses, we consider on a case-by-case basis whether the company has demonstrated a need for the defense in the context of promoting long-term share value; whether provisions of the defense are in line with generally accepted governance principles in the market (and specifically the presence of an adequate qualified offer provision that would exempt offers meeting certain conditions from the pill); and the specific context if the proposal is made in the midst of a takeover bid or contest for control.\n\n2 | Supermajority Voting Requirements: We generally oppose requirements for supermajority votes to amend the charter or bylaws, unless the provisions protect minority shareholders where there is a large shareholder.\n\nIn line with this view, in the absence of a large shareholder we support reasonable shareholder proposals to limit such supermajority voting requirements.", "Also, we oppose provisions that do not allow shareholders any right to amend the charter of bylaws.\n\n3 | Shareholders\n\nRight to Call a Special Meeting: We consider proposals to enhance a shareholder\u2019s rights to call meetings on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAt large-cap U.S. companies, we generally support efforts to establish the right of holders of 10% or more of shares to call special meetings, unless the board or state law has set a policy or law establishing such rights at a threshold that we believe to be acceptable.\n\n4 | Written Consent Rights: In the U.S. context, we examine proposals for shareholder written consent rights on a case-by-case basis.\n\n5 | Reincorporation: We consider management and shareholder proposals to reincorporate to a different jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis.\n\nWe oppose such proposals if we believe the main purpose is to take advantage of laws or judicial precedents that reduce shareholder rights.", "6 | Anti-greenmail Provisions: Proposals relating to the adoption of anti-greenmail provisions will be supported, provided that the proposal: (i) defines greenmail; (ii) prohibits buyback offers to large block holders (holders of at least 1% of the outstanding shares and in certain cases, a greater amount) not made to all shareholders or not approved by disinterested shareholders; and (iii) contains no anti-takeover measures or other provisions restricting the rights of shareholders.\n\n7 | Bundled Proposals: We may consider opposing or abstaining on proposals if disparate issues are \u201cbundled\u201d and presented for a single vote.\n\nG. Auditors.\n\nWe generally support management proposals for selection or ratification of independent auditors.", "However, we may consider opposing such proposals with reference to incumbent audit firms if the company has suffered from serious accounting irregularities and we believe rotation of the audit firm is appropriate, or if fees paid to the auditor for non-audit-related services are excessive.\n\nGenerally, to determine if non-audit fees are excessive, a 50% test will be applied (i.e., non-audit-related fees should be less than 50% of the total fees paid to the auditor).\n\nWe generally vote against proposals to indemnify auditors.\n\nH. Executive and Director Remuneration.\n\nWe generally support the following:\n\na | Proposals for employee equity compensation plans and other employee ownership plans, provided that our research does not indicate that approval of the plan would be against shareholder interest.", "Such approval may be against shareholder interest if it authorizes excessive dilution and shareholder cost, particularly in the context of high usage (\u201crun rate\u201d) of equity compensation in the recent past; or if there are objectionable plan design and provisions.\n\nb | Proposals relating to fees to outside directors, provided the amounts are not excessive relative to other companies in the country or industry, and provided that the structure is appropriate within the market context.\n\nWhile stock-based compensation to outside directors is positive if moderate and appropriately structured, we are wary of significant stock option awards or other performance-based awards for outside directors, as well as provisions that could result in significant forfeiture of value on a director\u2019s decision to resign from a board (such forfeiture can undercut director independence).", "c | Proposals for employee stock purchase plans that permit discounts, but only for grants that are part of a broad-based employee plan, including all non-executive employees, and only if the discounts are limited to a reasonable market standard or less.\n\nd | Proposals for the establishment of employee retirement and severance plans, provided that our research does not indicate that approval of the plan would be against shareholder interest.\n\nWe generally oppose retirement plans and bonuses for non-executive directors and independent statutory auditors.\n\nIn the U.S. context, we generally vote against shareholder proposals requiring shareholder approval of all severance agreements, but we generally support proposals that require shareholder approval for agreements in excess of three times the annual compensation (salary and bonus) or proposals that require companies to adopt a provision requiring an executive to receive accelerated vesting of\n\nBack to Table of Contents", "equity awards if there is a change of control and the executive is terminated.\n\nWe generally oppose shareholder proposals that would establish arbitrary caps on pay.\n\nWe consider on a case-by-case basis shareholder proposals that seek to limit Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (SERPs), but support such shareholder proposals where we consider SERPs excessive.\n\nShareholder proposals advocating stronger and/or particular pay-for-performance models will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of the merits of the individual proposal within the context of the particular company and its labor markets, and the company\u2019s current and past practices.\n\nWhile we generally support emphasis on long-term components of senior executive pay and strong linkage of pay to performance, we consider factors including whether a proposal may be overly prescriptive, and the impact of the proposal, if implemented as written, on recruitment and retention.", "We generally support proposals advocating reasonable senior executive and director stock ownership guidelines and holding requirements for shares gained in executive equity compensation programs.\n\nWe generally support shareholder proposals for reasonable \u201cclaw-back\u201d provisions that provide for company recovery of senior executive bonuses to the extent they were based on achieving financial benchmarks that were not actually met in light of subsequent restatements.\n\nManagement proposals effectively to re-price stock options are considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nConsiderations include the company\u2019s reasons and justifications for a re-pricing, the company\u2019s competitive position, whether senior executives and outside directors are excluded, potential cost to shareholders, whether the re-pricing or share exchange is on a value-for-value basis, and whether vesting requirements are extended.\n\nSay-on-Pay: We consider proposals relating to an advisory vote on remuneration on a case-by-case basis.", "Considerations include a review of the relationship between executive remuneration and performance based on operating trends and total shareholder return over multiple performance periods.\n\nIn addition, we review remuneration structures and potential poor pay practices, including relative magnitude of pay, discretionary bonus awards, tax gross ups, change-in-control features, internal pay equity and peer group construction.\n\nAs long-term investors, we support remuneration policies that align with long-term shareholder returns.\n\nI. Social and Environmental Issues\n\nShareholders in the United States and certain other markets submit proposals encouraging changes in company disclosure and practices related to particular social and environmental matters.\n\nRelevant social and environmental issues, including principal adverse sustainability impacts, may influence long-term risk and return.", "Consequently, investment teams may consider how to vote on proposals related to social and environmental issues on a case-by-case basis by determining the extent to which they believe the social and environmental issues identified in the proposal could impact shareholder value.\n\nIn reviewing proposals on such issues, investment teams may consider the financial materiality, including the company\u2019s exposure to the risk or opportunity, the management of such issues and a company\u2019s current disclosures.\n\nIn assessing and prioritizing proposals, we carefully reflect on the potential financial materiality of the issues as well as the sector and geography in which the company operates.\n\nWe also consider the explanation companies provide where they may depart from best practice to assess the adequacy and appropriateness of measures that are in place.", "Investment teams may seek to balance concerns on reputational, operational, litigation and other risks that lie behind a proposal against costs of implementation, while considering appropriate shareholder and management prerogatives.\n\nInvestment teams may abstain from voting on proposals that do not have a readily determinable financial impact on shareholder value and may oppose proposals that intrude excessively on management prerogatives and/or board discretion.\n\nInvestment teams may generally vote against proposals requesting reports or actions they believe are duplicative, related to matters not considered by the investment team to be financially material to the business, or that would impose unnecessary or excessive costs.\n\nWe consider proposals on these sustainability risks, opportunities and impacts on a case-by-case basis but generally support proposals that seek to enhance useful disclosure.", "We focus on understanding the company\u2019s business and commercial context and recognise that there is no one size fits all that can apply to all companies.\n\nEnvironmental Issues\n\nWe generally support proposals that, if implemented, would enhance useful disclosure on climate, biodiversity, and other environmental risks, such as disclosures aligned with SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) and the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) for companies for which such issues may be financially material.\n\nWe also generally support proposals that aim to ensure companies communicate credibly on their commitments to manage reputational risks.\n\nAs such, we generally support proposals that aim to encourage companies to use independently verified Science\n\nBased Targets to ensure emissions are in line with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which should ultimately help companies who seek to manage long-term climate-related risks do so in a way that remains credible.", "We generally will support reasonable proposals to reduce negative environmental impacts and ameliorate a company\u2019s overall environmental footprint, including any threats to biodiversity in ecologically sensitive areas.\n\nWe generally will also support proposals asking companies to report on their environmental practices, policies and impacts, including environmental damage and health risks resulting from operations, and the impact of environmental liabilities on shareholder value.\n\nBack to Table of Contents\n\nSocial Issues\n\nWe generally support proposals that, if implemented, would enhance useful disclosure on employee and board diversity, including gender, race, and other factors, for companies where such issues could be considered by the investment teams as financially material.\n\nWe consider proposals on other social issues on a case-by-case basis but generally support proposals that:", "\u25a0 |  Seek to enhance useful disclosure or improvements on material issues such as human rights risks, supply chain management.\n\nworkplace safety, human capital management and pay equity in line with local rules.\n\n\u25a0 |  Encourage policies to eliminate gender-based violence and other forms of harassment from the workplace.\n\n\u25a0 |  Seek disclosure of relevant diversity policies and meaningful workforce diversity data, including EEO-1 data.\n\nWe consider proposals on other social issues on a case-by-case basis but generally support proposals that: Seek to enhance transparency through disclosures on supply chain management, particularly in cases where this is a financially material risk.\n\nWe may consider withholding support where we have material concerns in relation to a company\u2019s involvement/remediation of a breach of global conventions such as UN Global Compact Principles on Human Rights, Labour Standards, Environment and Business Malpractice.\n\nJ. Funds of Funds", "Certain MS Funds advised by an MSIM Affiliate invest only in other MS Funds.\n\nIf an underlying fund has a shareholder meeting, in order to avoid any potential conflict of interest, such proposals will be voted in the same proportion as the votes of the other shareholders of the underlying fund, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.\n\nIn markets where proportional voting is not available we will not vote at the meeting, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.\n\nOther MS Funds invest in unaffiliated funds.\n\nIf an unaffiliated underlying fund has a shareholder meeting and the MS Fund owns more than 25% of the voting shares of the underlying fund, the MS Fund will vote its shares in the unaffiliated underlying fund in the same proportion as the votes of the other shareholders of the underlying fund to the extent possible.", "Voting Conditions Triggered Under Rule 12d1-4.

investors.", "Pursuant to Section 7 of the Registrant\u2019s Underwriting Agreement, the Registrant shall indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter against any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense (including the reasonable cost of investigating or defending any alleged loss, liability, claim, damage or expense and reasonable counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) arising by reason of any person acquiring any Shares, which may be based upon the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cAct\u201d), or on any other statute or at common law, on the grounds that the Registration Statement or related Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information, as from time to time amended and supplemented, or the annual or interim reports to shareholders of the Registrant, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, unless such statement or omission was made in reliance upon, and in conformity with, information furnished to the Registrant in connection therewith by or on behalf of the Underwriter; provided, however, that in no case (i) is the indemnity of the Registrant in favor of the Underwriter and any such controlling persons to be deemed to protect the Underwriter or any such controlling persons thereof against any liability to the Registrant or its security holders to which the Underwriter or any such controlling persons would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement; or (ii) is the Registrant to be liable under its indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph with respect to any claim made against the Underwriter or any such controlling persons, unless the Underwriter or any such controlling persons, as the case may be, shall have notified the Registrant in writing within a reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon the Underwriter or such controlling persons (or after the Underwriter or such controlling persons shall have received notice of such service on any designated agent), but failure to notify the Registrant of any such claim shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to the person against whom such action is brought otherwise than on account of its indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph.", "Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Act may be permitted to trustees, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.", "In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a trustee, officer, or controlling person of the Registrant in connection with the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted against the Registrant by such trustee, officer or controlling person in connection with the shares being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act, and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.", "The Registrant hereby undertakes that it will apply the indemnification provision of its by-laws in a manner consistent with Release 11330 of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so long as the interpretation of Sections 17(h) and 17(i) of such Act remains in effect.\n\nThe Registrant, in conjunction with the Investment Adviser, the Registrant\u2019s Trustees, and other registered investment management companies managed by the Investment Adviser, maintains insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Trustee, officer, employee, or agent of the Registrant, or who is or was serving at the request of the Registrant as a trustee, director, officer, employee or agent of another trust or corporation, against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him or arising out of his position.", "However, in no event will Registrant maintain insurance to indemnify any such person for any act for which the Registrant itself is not permitted to indemnify him.\n\nITEM 31.\n\nBusiness and Other Connections of Investment Adviser\n\nSee \u201cFund Management\u201d in the Prospectus regarding the business of the investment adviser.\n\nThe following
